# An Invitation to Entrepreneurs Seeking a Surer Path to Success {.unnumbered}

An expedition is a journey made for a specific purpose. Expeditionary innovation is a journey that starts with the purpose of uncovering the unmet needs of customers before developing a solution. This process significantly increases the chances of success by transforming uncertainty into knowledge gained through discovery. In my experience, when entrepreneurs fully embrace this process, it almost always leads to successful innovation.


## Focus on Success {.unnumbered}

Entrepreneurship often emphasizes failure. Informed entrepreneurs know the importance of *failing early*, *failing often*, and, most importantly, *failing cheaply*. In contrast, uninformed entrepreneurs tend to fail slowly and expensively.

This focus on failure comes from the recognition that most startups fail and that successful ones usually iterate through course corrections based on customer feedback. Instead of committing to a full business plan from the start and risking a large investment on an untested idea, entrepreneurs should test their ideas with customers and adapt (*pivot*) when necessary.[^index-1]

[^index-1]: A series of books, including *Four Steps to the Epiphany* [@blank06], *Nail It Then Scale It* [@furr-ahlstrom11], *The Lean Startup* [@ries11], and *The Startup Owner's Manual* [@blank-dorf12], highlight the risks of premature commitment to business plans and advocate for a path of failing fast, pivoting, and repeating until finding a fit between the product and the customers. This methodology is now widely known as lean entrepreneurship.


## Overcome The Challenge of Uncertainty {.unnumbered}

The logic of "fail fast" stems from dealing with uncertainty. Uncertainty is defined by a lack of knowledge about the actions we can take and the potential outcomes of those actions.[^index-2] Without this knowledge, failure often seems more likely than success. The numerous decisions that are shrouded in uncertainty in a startup increase the likelihood of failure when faced with uncertainty.

[^index-2]: Uncertainty differs from risk, though both involve unknown outcomes. With risk, we know the choices (e.g., rolling a die), the possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6), and the probabilities (1/6 each). In uncertainty, we lack a complete understanding of the choices and potential results.

If failure is inevitable, minimizing the cost in money and time becomes crucial. One approach is _random search_: generating an idea, quickly building a minimum viable product, and testing it with customers. If it fails, iterate with a new idea. While this process might eventually lead to success, the probability of a randomly chosen idea being a good one is extremely low. It could take hundreds or thousands of iterations to find a successful idea, which is not feasible for most entrepreneurs. There are too many stable career paths to justify such extensive failure.



## Embrace The Opportunity of Uncertainty {.unnumbered}

The "fail fast" approach assumes that what is unknown is also unknowable until the right combination of features ultimately aligns the product with customer needs. This perspective underestimates entrepreneurs' ability to learn and reduce uncertainty through discovery.

We can learn from failure. When an idea is rejected, it often reveals that customers appreciate some aspects while rejecting others. Although the idea as a whole may be flawed, parts of it are valuable. By identifying the features that resonate with customers, we progressively move closer to success through iterative learning.

However, failure is not the only, nor the best, source of learning. We can deliberately learn about customers and their unmet needs before even formulating a product idea. When we thoroughly understand our customers, the solutions we create are more likely to meet their needs and succeed. This book explores the potential of __learning before failure__.


## Expeditionary Innovation {.unnumbered}

Expeditionary innovation is a process designed to maximize the probability of successful innovation for entrepreneurs. While failing fast is preferable to failing slowly or expensively, it is even better to avoid failure altogether. Uncertainty is a primary cause of startup failureâ€”not only do we lack crucial knowledge, but our instincts often lead us astray.

Expeditionary innovation aims to replace the unknown with the newly known. By drawing on the scientific method, entrepreneurs can confidently cycle between *exploratory* and *confirmatory* experiments to target and acquire the knowledge needed for success. These tools enable entrepreneurs to embrace uncertainty and solve problems that others cannot.

I have chosen the [Cassia crossbill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassia_crossbill) (_Loxia sinesciuris_) for the cover art of this book.  The Cassia crossbill is a finch with a criss-crossed beak that has co-evolved with the lodgepole pines of Southern Idaho.  The absence of red squirrels in this area left a gap in seed dispersal compared to other areas.  "Finding" this unfilled need in the ecosystem, the Cassia crossbill developed deeper bills to access seeds in the co-evolving thick scaled cones of the lodgepole pines. 

The first key to success in innovating in extreme uncertainty is to find a previously unknown need and fill it.  The people with these needs will be thrilled by the attention that existing companies deny them. We will succeed by seeking gaps in the market that are not only unfilled but also unknown, much like the Cassia crossbill.
