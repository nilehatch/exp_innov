## Unearthing Unmet Needs

![Divergent exploration of the community of people to gain insight for better hypotheses of customer pain.](images/221_pain_diverge.svg){.wrapfig_left_25}
After choosing and confirming access to a community of people, the journey of entrepreneurial innovation continues with an in-depth exploration of their lives. This chapter focuses on *ethnographic exploratory experiments*—our deliberate move into divergent thinking—aimed at amassing a “mountain of data” about your chosen community. At this stage, the emphasis is on extensive evidence gathering through both *primary* and *secondary* research. You are not merely collecting anecdotes; you are running exploratory experiments—structured forays into lived experience—to surface pains that are real but often unarticulated.

<!-- As you work, the goal is to collect enough raw evidence to ground abductive sense-making, theme finding, persona building, and experience mapping. -->
Secondary research will help you triangulate what you learn in the field so you don’t waste time re-learning what is already known.

::: {.callout-note title="The Sounds of Frustration"}
One innovation team thought they understood the pain in auto body repair. Customers hated long delays and unpredictable updates while their cars were in the shop. The problem seemed obvious: fix customer communications.

Then they spent time inside a repair shop. While waiting in the office, a burst of shouting echoed from down the hall. Instead of ignoring it, they followed the sound and found a technician furious at the tedious process of moving information back and forth with insurance adjusters. Estimates had to be re-typed into one system, then again into another, with errors compounding at each step.

In that moment, the team realized the real bottleneck wasn’t customers waiting for news—it was employees drowning in broken data flows. By listening for emotion and tracing frustration to its source, they uncovered a more valuable, systemic pain: the brittle exchange of information between insurers and shops.
:::

*This* is the essence of ethnographic exploration. We go in expecting one kind of problem, but if we stay curious and follow emotion, we uncover pains hidden in plain sight. The methods that follow—conversation as guided storytelling, observation and shadowing in context, role play as embodied empathy, and carefully targeted surveys—are the tools for creating these moments of discovery. Alongside them, secondary research broadens and triangulates what you learn in the field so you avoid spending time re-learning what is already known.  

As you work, watch the “information entropy” of your findings. When new stories keep surprising you, keep exploring. When new data starts repeating what you already know, you’ve reached the edge of your current map. That’s the moment to shift from divergence into abductive synthesis and begin the converge work of themes, personas, and experience maps.



## Finding and Engaging Your People

Now that you’ve selected your community and confirmed access in principle, the next challenge is practical: where do these people actually gather, and how do you engage them in a way that leads to real exploration? Treat this step as an **access experiment**: you’re testing which channels, places, and approaches reliably put you inside their world so you can run ethnographic, exploratory experiments (conversation, observation, shadowing, role play) that build your mountain of data.

### Show Up Where They Are (Physical Contexts)

- **Map the day-in-the-life.** List places and times your community naturally congregates (worksites, clinics, gyms, trade counters, meetups, shops, service desks, transportation hubs). Prioritize locations with *high density + high dwell time*.
- **Respect gatekeepers.** Identify who controls access (managers, front-desk staff, community leaders). Prepare a concise, respectful ask: who you are, what you’re studying, how long it takes, and what participants gain (voice, learning, small thank-you).
- **Observe before you approach.** Spend 10–15 minutes watching flow, queues, and rhythms. Enter at the least disruptive moment. Note visible frustrations or workarounds you might probe later.
- **Start with low-friction intercepts.** A simple opener: “I’m studying how *X* gets done here—could I ask two quick questions now, or schedule 15 minutes later?” Offer a QR card or short link to book time.
- **Earn permission for deeper immersion.** If the first chat is productive, ask for a *follow-on* exploratory experiment: shadow a task, watch a handoff, review artifacts (forms, screenshots), or co-walk the space.
- **Bring a leave-behind and a follow-up plan.** Share contact info, a 1–2 sentence description of the study, and how you’ll use what you learn. Schedule next steps while the rapport is warm.

### Engage Where They Gather Online (Digital Contexts)

- **Find domain-centric communities.** Look for forums, subreddits, Discord/Slack groups, professional associations, Facebook/LinkedIn groups, and niche platforms specific to the craft or role.
- **Evaluate group quality.** Prefer communities with active moderation, recent posts, and discussion depth. Skim the last 50 posts to spot recurring pains and the group’s tone.
- **Introduce yourself with value.** Post a brief intro: what you’re exploring, who you want to hear from, the time ask, and what participants get (e.g., early findings summary). Avoid selling or hinting at solutions.
- **Use light-touch prompts.** Run a 1–2 question poll or ask “last time” prompts (e.g., “What was the last time *X* really frustrated you?”). Invite DMs for private stories.
- **Move from public to private thoughtfully.** After a comment exchange, invite a short call or asynchronous Q&A. Provide a scheduler and options across time zones.
- **Bypass personal-network bias.** Do not rely on friends/classmates. Seek practitioners and decision-makers inside the community, not adjacent observers.

::: {.callout-warning title="Common Pitfalls When Finding and Engaging"}
- **Convenience over relevance:** recruiting whoever is nearby rather than those who live the pain daily.
- **Platform monoculture:** using only one channel; diversify physical and digital touchpoints.
- **Too-broad groups:** “small business owners” instead of a specific role + context (e.g., collision estimators at independent body shops).
- **Gatekeeper dead-ends:** not preparing a clear, respectful script and small value exchange to earn access.
- **Survey-first reflex:** launching a survey before you’ve heard stories; start with conversations and observation.
- **Extractive tone:** asking for time without giving anything back (learning, summary, shout-out, or scheduling around their constraints).
- **Pitching too soon:** discussing solutions in first contact; stay in exploration mode.
:::

Avoiding these traps clears the path for authentic engagement. But clarity about what not to do is only half the battle; here’s a practical checklist to help you move forward with confidence.

### From Access to Exploration

Once you are in the room—or in the feed—design *exploratory experiments* that surface lived experience: guided storytelling conversations, in-context observation and shadowing, role play to experience constraints, and targeted follow-up surveys. In the next sections, we’ll detail each of these experiments and how to run them with rigor.

::: {.callout-tip title="Quick Start Checklist"}
- [ ] List 5 physical places and 5 digital communities where your people gather.
- [ ] Identify gatekeepers and draft a 3–4 sentence access script.
- [ ] Plan two low-friction intercepts (1 physical, 1 digital) you can execute this week.
- [ ] Prepare a scheduler link and a 2–3 question “last time” prompt for follow-ups.
- [ ] Define your success signal for access (e.g., 10 qualified conversations scheduled).
:::
  
  
## Ethnographic Exploration

Once you have found and engaged your people, the next step is to immerse yourself in their lived experience. Ethnographers use many tools, but four stand out as especially powerful for entrepreneurs: **conversations, observation, role playing, and surveys**. Each is not just a technique but an exploratory experiment — a structured way to surface evidence of unmet needs.


### Conversations  

Conversations are not casual chats — they are **guided storytelling experiments**.  
When you invite someone to share their experiences, you are deliberately probing for patterns in how people live, what frustrates them, and where needs are unmet. Done well, these conversations move beyond surface opinions to uncover the rich, emotional stories that anchor entrepreneurial insight.

But don’t ask people, *“What do you need?”* — they usually can’t answer. Instead, people reveal their struggles through stories. Your job is to guide those stories toward moments of frustration, emotion, or workaround. That is when unmet needs surface.

::: callout-note
Use a conversation guide. Prepare open-ended prompts (e.g., “Tell me about the last time you…”), but stay flexible. Your goal is not a script but a framework to keep the dialogue flowing.
:::

#### How to run the experiment (short form)

1. Prepare a light interview protocol — a few “last time” prompts, not a long script.  
2. Meet people in their context (kitchen, workshop, office, shop floor).  
3. Encourage storytelling: “Tell me about the last time you…”  
4. Listen for emotional spikes — frustration, embarrassment, delight.  
5. Probe gently: “What made that difficult?” “What did you do next?”  
6. Capture notes and stories; debrief with your team immediately after.  

*Success measure*: when people forget they are being “interviewed” and simply tell you their story, you are doing it right.

#### Worked Example: Halo Alert
While exploring safety in senior living facilities, the Halo Alert team interviewed staff about emergency response systems. At first, staff talked about the equipment itself. But when prompted for stories, one nurse shared her fear when a pendant button didn’t transmit during a nighttime fall. That emotional spike — fear of failure at a critical moment — revealed a deeper pain than “buttons are old.” The team realized they were dealing with trust in life-and-death reliability, not just product usability.

::: {.callout-warning title="Common Questions: *“How many interviews do we need?”*"}
There’s no fixed number. Early on, every conversation reveals new stories (high information entropy). Keep going until stories begin to repeat and new interviews add little that’s novel. That’s your signal to pause and move into convergence.
:::

See the [Interview Guide](link-to-toolkit-or-appendix) for a ready-to-use protocol, sample prompts, and a notes template.  


### Observation

Observation is not passive watching — it is an **experiment in context**.  
Sometimes the most powerful insights come not from what people say, but from what they do. By placing yourself where people live, work, or struggle, you see routines, interactions, and workarounds unfold in their natural setting. Done well, observation reveals unspoken needs and patterns that conversations often miss.

::: callout-note
Look for moments of friction. When people improvise, complain under their breath, or devise a workaround, they are revealing unmet needs in action.  
:::

#### How to run the experiment (short form)

- Choose a setting where your community naturally gathers (gym, café, clinic, workplace, trade counter, online forum).  
- Blend in: be present without becoming the center of attention.  
- Take **structured notes** on behaviors, contexts, and interactions before interpreting them:

    1. *What are they doing?* (observable facts)  
    2. *How are they doing it?* (effort, workarounds, emotion)  
    3. *Why this way?* (informed guesses about motives and constraints)  
    4. *What are they interacting with?* (people, tools, systems, spaces)  
    5. *What is absent?* (who is missing, which steps are skipped, or what resources are absent)  

- Watch for **workarounds**, repeated **frustrations**, hesitations, delays, and subtle **rituals** that hint at unmet needs.  

*Success measure*: when you can describe how a day actually unfolds for your community, not just what they say about it.


#### Worked Example: Halo Alert
One team shadowed older adults at a senior center. They noticed many wore personal medical devices but hesitated to press emergency buttons in social situations. This insight — **observed, not declared** — suggested a need for safety technology that avoids stigma.

::: {.callout-note title="Common Questions: *“How do I start observing without it being awkward?”*"}
Enter through a **natural artifact or activity**. For example, a Shakespeare reading group brings seniors together around the play, but the real learning comes from the informal conversations and behaviors that follow. Anchor yourself in the activity; the observation will flow naturally.
:::

**Toolkit Resource**  
See the [Observation Template](link-to-toolkit-or-appendix) for a ready-to-use field note structure, a quick “flow map” sketch box, and a checklist of common signals to watch for.  


### Role Playing

Role playing is not theater for its own sake — it is an **experiment in simulation**.  
By enacting real or imagined scenarios, you and your participants surface hidden reactions, tacit knowledge, and unspoken assumptions. Role play creates a safe space to test how people might behave in situations that are rare, risky, or difficult to observe directly.

::: callout-note
Use role playing to reveal what people cannot easily articulate. It often exposes emotional responses, social dynamics, and decision shortcuts that surveys or conversations miss.  
:::

#### When to use role playing

- To simulate situations that are hard to observe in the wild (e.g., emergencies, negotiations).  
- To uncover emotional reactions or group dynamics around a scenario.  
- To test prototypes or service concepts in a “lived” context before building them.  

#### Design principles

- Ground the scenario in realistic detail (context, roles, stakes).  
- Encourage participants to stay “in character” but debrief afterwards.  
- Observe both behavior and language — especially moments of tension or improvisation.  
- Keep the setup simple so the focus stays on people, not props.  

*Success measure*: When role play reveals responses, workarounds, or tensions that people themselves did not realize they carried, the experiment has done its job.  

#### Worked Example
Designer Patty Moore once simulated aging by wearing a body brace, earplugs, blurred glasses, and a wig over months of immersion. She discovered not only the physical challenges of opening pill bottles and climbing buses but also the social reality of how others treated her differently.^[Patnaik [-@patnaik09] tells this story in *Wired to Care* to illustrate how designers can create deep empathy through embodied simulation.]  



### Surveys

Surveys are not just questionnaires — they are **structured experiments in convergence**.  
Once you’ve uncovered pains and themes through conversations and observation, surveys let you measure prevalence, compare subgroups, and begin quantifying what matters most.  

::: callout-note
Use surveys to validate, not to explore. They are powerful once hypotheses exist, but too blunt to discover fresh insights on their own.  
:::

#### When to use surveys

- To validate and rank insights gained from conversations and observation.  
- To measure how widespread frustrations are across a population.  
- To gather input from communities you cannot easily observe or interview.  

#### Design principles

- Use open-ended prompts sparingly but strategically (e.g., “What is the hardest part of X?”).  
- Include ranking or rating scales to gauge relative importance.  
- Pilot-test questions to catch bias or ambiguity.  
- Keep them short and focused — long surveys rarely yield thoughtful responses.  


*Success measure*: When your survey sharpens which pains matter most and how widespread they are, the experiment has done its job.  

---

Together, these four exploratory experiments — conversations, observation, role playing, and surveys — build the mountain of data you need. Each generates different kinds of evidence, but all share a common purpose: uncovering unmet needs that remain invisible until you engage, watch, feel, and measure. Together, they create the mountain of data you need — but how do you know when that mountain is high enough?




## Archival and Secondary Research Experiments

Not every insight comes from fieldwork. Much is already known — in industry reports, government statistics, academic studies, and trade publications. Secondary research is your way of running **exploratory experiments with data others have already collected**. Each probe into an archive or database is a test: *“What does this source reveal, and how does it align with or challenge what I’ve seen in the field?”*

The key principle: **if it is already known, don’t rediscover it through interviews or observation.** Mine existing knowledge so you can focus your primary exploration on what is still unknown.

### What Secondary Research Contributes

- **Customer insights**: demographics, preferences, usage patterns, and emerging behaviors.  
- **Market analysis**: product landscapes, market shares, and total addressable market.  
- **Competitor analysis**: who else is addressing your space, and how.  
- **Industry trends**: technological shifts, regulatory moves, cultural currents.  

Secondary research rarely reveals unmet needs directly. But combined with ethnographic exploration, it frames the opportunity landscape and sharpens your hypotheses.^[Ethington (2018) notes that while no single source can answer the entrepreneur’s core questions, triangulating across multiple studies helps reveal where unmet needs are most likely to emerge.]

### Open and Free Sources

- **Government and public data**: portals like [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/statistics) or the [US Census](https://www.census.gov).  
- **Search trends**: [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) shows what people are looking for, when, and where.  
- **Global indicators**: [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) for worldwide demographic, health, and social data.  
- **Business press and consulting insights**: sources like *Harvard Business Review*, *Forbes*, or consulting firms (e.g., BCG, McKinsey).  

For a more comprehensive collection of open and free sources of secondary data, explore these [public data sources](https://ba.nilehatch.com/public_data.html).

### Proprietary and Paid Sources

Some of the richest insights live behind paywalls: databases like Factiva, Mintel, or Euromonitor. While costly for startups, many universities and libraries provide access. At BYU, for example, the Harold B. Lee Library maintains a [database index](https://guides.lib.byu.edu/EntInnovHatch) curated for entrepreneurial innovation projects.

For a more comprehensive collection of open and free sources of secondary data, explore these [private data sources](https://ba.nilehatch.com/private_data.html).

::: callout-note
#### How to Use Secondary Research Effectively
1. **Start with it** — scan existing knowledge before entering the field, so your primary research targets what isn’t already known.  
2. **Use it to triangulate** — compare published findings with what you hear and see in context.  
3. **Treat it as experiment design** — each search is a probe: *“If I look here, what will I learn?”*  
4. **Document both findings and absences** — what you expected but didn’t find can be a clue.  
:::

---

In short, archival and secondary research experiments widen your vision. They prevent reinventing knowledge, situate your field insights in broader context, and strengthen confidence that the pains you uncover are real, significant, and shaped by larger trends.

At some point, though, both fieldwork and desk research begin to repeat themselves. The real question becomes: **when is the mountain of data high enough?** That’s where the principle of “enough is enough” comes in.

---

## When Enough Is Enough: Watching Information Entropy

Exploration can feel endless. There is always another person you could interview, another setting to observe, or another report to read. But at some point, the return on effort drops. The signal to stop is not exhaustion or impatience — it is the decline of **information entropy**.  

At the beginning, every conversation, observation, or article adds something novel. Over time, surprises become rarer, and new inputs mostly echo what you have already heard or read. This flattening of novelty is your cue: the mountain of data is high enough. You are no longer climbing higher, just circling the same slope.  

Stopping does not mean you know everything. It means you have reached the point where **abductive sense-making** — generating and testing hypotheses — becomes more productive than continued collection.  

::: callout-note
**Rule of thumb**  
- If most new conversations yield no fresh themes, stop.  
- If additional observations only confirm existing patterns, stop.  
- If reports and databases repeat the same facts, stop.  
:::

Entrepreneurs often struggle here. Quitting too early risks thin data and shaky insights. Quitting too late risks delay and wasted effort. But when novelty fades, and repetition dominates, the exploration phase has done its work. It is time to move from gathering to reasoning — from raw discovery to shaping hypotheses that can be tested.

---

In short, the goal of exploratory experiments — whether in the field or in the archives — is not to collect every possible fact but to reach the point where additional data stops changing the picture. At that moment, you are ready to shift from divergence into convergence and move toward isolating the pains that matter most.

## The Essence of Exploratory Research

Exploratory research is not about confirming what you already know — it is about **broadening your field of vision**. Its essence is curiosity: stepping into conversations, watching behavior in context, simulating lived experience, and mining what is already known in archives and reports. Each method — whether an interview, an observation, a role play, a survey, or a scan of existing data — is an exploratory experiment designed to surface unmet needs that would otherwise remain invisible.

What matters most is not mastering every method, but **assembling a diverse stream of evidence**. Stories, observed workarounds, simulated frustrations, survey rankings, and statistical trends each illuminate the problem space from a different angle. Taken together, they create a textured picture of people’s lives and the opportunities within them.

But exploration cannot be endless. The true art lies in **knowing when the mountain of data is high enough** — when novelty begins to fade, and it is time to shift from gathering to sense-making. Exploratory research gives you raw material; abductive reasoning and analysis turn that material into insight.

In short: the essence of exploratory research is open-ended curiosity, disciplined variety, and the judgment to stop collecting when learning plateaus. With that balance, you are prepared to move from exploration toward convergence and the identification of your most urgent unknown.

## When Enough Is Enough

Every conversation, observation, role play, survey, or dataset adds to your mountain of knowledge. At first, each new piece feels fresh and surprising. But over time, novelty fades. Answers begin to repeat, and new sources confirm rather than extend what you already know. This is the signal that **information entropy is dropping** — the flow of newness has slowed.

That is when exploration has done its job. You don’t stop because you have exhausted every possibility, but because the marginal return on each new probe is near zero. Further conversations or reports will only echo what you have already heard.

Knowing when enough is enough is not a precise calculation; it is a matter of judgment. But the principle is clear: when new evidence consistently echoes what you already know, it is time to stop climbing the mountain and begin making sense of its shape. Exploration hands off to abduction and analysis — the stage where raw insights become hypotheses and direction for your next experiments.

After choosing and confirming access to a community of people, the journey of entrepreneurial innovation continues with an in-depth exploration of their lives. This chapter delves into generative, exploratory experiments---our journey into divergent thinking---aimed at amassing a "mountain of data" about the selected community. At this stage, the emphasis is on extensive data collection, through both *primary* and *secondary research*, laying the groundwork for later interpretation and hypothesis formation. This process will reveal valuable insights, guiding us toward identifying unmet needs worthy of innovative solutions.

#### Learning from Failure to Explore: Gillette's Revised Approach in India {.unnumbered}

Gillette's revised strategy in India is a prime example of the effectiveness of starting with a thorough understanding of customer needs. Faced with the challenge that 500 million Indian men still relied on traditional safety razors, Gillette adopted a more customer-centric approach that ultimately led to a product embraced by the market.
  

##### Gillette's Exploratory Experiment

1.  **In-Depth Primary Research**: A Gillette team comprising 20 executives, developers, and engineers was dispatched to India. Over three weeks, they dedicated more than 3000 hours to engage with over 1000 potential customers.
2.  **Ethnographic Insights**: he team immersed themselves in the daily routines of these men, observing shaving practices in their homes and conducting interviews about their experiences, aspirations, and the role of shaving in their lives.
3.  **Informed Product Development**: With their mountain of data, Gillette innovators gleaned key insights that informed the development of a new razor. This product, tailored to the unique needs of the Indian market, underwent successful testing with customers, confirming its viability.

This chapter of Gillette's story underscores the importance of an immersive, data-first approach. By focusing on understanding and addressing the real, unmet needs of customers, Gillette significantly reduced the risk of failure and achieved a successful innovation outcome.



### When Enough is Enough (for Now)

How many conversations, observations, or role plays are enough?\ 
There’s no magic number — the signal comes from the stories themselves. Early on, every new encounter feels like a fresh puzzle piece. Over time, you’ll notice the same frustrations, workarounds, and emotions repeating. The rate of new insight slows down.  

<!-- Think of it as watching **information entropy** fall: at first, the “uncertainty” in your picture of the community is high. With each new story, the uncertainty drops — until eventually the new stories add more confirmation than surprise. That’s your sign to pause.  -->

Stopping here doesn’t mean you know everything. It means you know enough to shift into convergence — comparing stories, clustering pains, and deciding what matters most. Later, secondary research and further experiments will add depth and breadth.  

::: callout-note
A good rule of thumb: if three consecutive interviews or observations add nothing truly novel, you’re probably at saturation for this round.  
:::


### When Enough Is Enough

Secondary research has the same curve of diminishing returns as ethnographic exploration. At first, every report feels like a fresh angle; over time, findings repeat and surprises fade. That drop in **information entropy** — the rate of newness in what you learn — is your signal to stop gathering and move into abductive sense-making.^[The concept of information entropy comes from Claude Shannon’s work in communication theory (1948). In this context, it refers to how much “surprise” each new piece of data brings.]
