title: Supporting Experiment Template
---

> Every **Supporting Experiment** should be linked in your **Primary Experiment** document and tracked in your **Experiment Log Tracker**.\
> \
> - **Primary Experiment Template** documents your full inquiry into a major unknown. It will often include multiple forms of data collection and synthesis over time.\
> - **Supporting Experiment Template** documents each individual exploratory, confirmatory, or technical experiment. These are the building blocks that generate evidence, insight, or surprise.

<!--
Use this for each **individual data collection instance** (observation, intercept interview, brief interaction, etc.). These are the building blocks for exploratory synthesis.

## General Info
- **Title / Observation Type**:
- **Date**:
- **Location / Setting**:
- **Team Member(s)**:
- **Modality** (e.g., Interview, Observation, etc.):
- **Linked Primary Experiment**:


## 1. Clarify the Unknown 

- **Most Urgent Unknown**: What uncertainty are you trying to reduce?
- **Other Urgent Unknowns**: Why is this one most pressing?

## 2. Experiment Type

- **Exploratory Experiments**:  Used to uncover patterns, insights, or hypotheses. Often open-ended and inductive. For example, observation, conversation, secondary research
- **Confirmatory Experiments**: Used to test clear formal hypotheses. Controlled, deductive, and evidence-seeking. For example, people access test, customer pain validation, solution validation
- **Technical Experiments**: Used to compare, validate, or refine solution design and implementation decisions. Focused on how things work, not just what people think or do. For example, quick A/B tests, micro-validations, component trials, usability checks


## 3. Modality and Fit

- **Modality Chosen** (e.g., Interview, Observation, Survey, etc.):
- **Why it fits** this unknown:

## 4. Design

- **Source of Evidence**:
- **Collection Mechanism** (Interview guide, survey, etc.):
- **Sampling Strategy**:
- **Sample Size Goal**:

## 5. Execution Notes

- What did you actually do?
- Who did you reach?
- Deviations from the plan? Surprises?
- Sampling biases?

## 6. Results and Data Summary

- Link raw data, quotes, tables, etc.
- Highlight key findings:

## 7. Knowledge Updating

- What do you now know?
- How confident are you? Why?
- What assumptions did you update or abandon?

## 8. Next Steps

- What are you doing next based on this experiment?

<!--
## Field Notes
- What did you see, hear, feel, or record?
- Quotes or highlights?
- Unexpected moments or reactions?

## Initial Reflection
- What might this mean?
- How strong is the signal?
