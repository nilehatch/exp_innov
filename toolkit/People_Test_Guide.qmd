# Access Test Guide {#sec-access-test-guide .unnumbered} 

#### Confirming whether your chosen people are observable, reachable, and willing to engage {.subtitle}

This guide should be used with the methods outlined in [Chapter @sec-test-people-chapter].

---

## Purpose {.unnumbered}

Before you invest in conversations or observations, confirm that you can **reliably reach your chosen people**. Access testing answers a simple but essential question: *Can we actually engage them, repeatedly and meaningfully?*  

A passed access test = you know **where** your people are, you can **reach** them directly, and they are **willing to engage**.

## 1. Define Your Group {.unnumbered}

- **Chosen people/community:** ___  
- **Why this group matters:** ___  
- **Typical settings or gathering places:** ___  

---

## 2. Minimum Access Conditions {.unnumbered}

Check each box only if evidence supports it (not just assumptions):  

- [ ] We can **find them** (specific places, online/offline)  
- [ ] We can **engage them** (via DM, email, intercept, observation, etc.)  
- [ ] They **respond and open up** (willing to talk, reflect, and share stories)

## 3. Test Design {.unnumbered}

- **Channels to test:** ___  
- **Sample size goal:** ___  
- **Method (DM, intercept, post, visit, etc.):** ___  
- **Timeline:** ___

## 4. Execution Notes {.unnumbered}

- What did you actually do? ___  
- How many people did you attempt to reach? ___  
- How many responded positively? ___  
- Quality of responses (surface vs. depth): ___  
- Any barriers or surprises? ___

## 5. Results & Signal Strength {.unnumbered}

- **Strong access (green light):** People responded quickly, openly, and repeatedly.  
- **Weak access (yellow light):** Responses limited, shallow, or hard to replicate.  
- **Blocked access (red light):** Could not reliably find, reach, or engage.  

**Your assessment:** ___

## 6. Knowledge Update {.unnumbered}

- What do you now know about access to this group? ___  
- What assumptions did you validate or overturn? ___  
- Did you learn anything about subgroups, gatekeepers, or hidden barriers? ___

## 7. Next Steps {.unnumbered}

- If green: Plan your first exploratory conversations/observations.  
- If yellow: Refine channels, messaging, or sampling strategy.  
- If red: Loop back to convergence; reconsider your chosen people.  

___
**Attachments (Data Room pointers):**  
- Screenshot of messages/posts sent
