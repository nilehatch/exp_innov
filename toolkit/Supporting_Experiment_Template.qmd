# Supporting Experiment Template {#sec-supporting-experiment-template .unnumbered}

#### Use this template to design and conduct exploratory, confirmatory, and technical experiments {.subtitle} 

## Supporting Experiments

This template is used to document the many supporting experiments that comprise a single primary experiment.  Each supporting experiment is drawn from a slice from the divergent stage of one of the triple diamonds. Some common supporting experiments include

- **Exploratory Experiments**: Used to uncover patterns, insights, or hypotheses. Often open-ended and inductive. For example, observation, conversation, secondary research, ideation
- **Confirmatory Experiments**: Used to test a clear hypothesis. Controlled, deductive, and evidence-seeking. For example, people access test, customer pain validation, solution validation
- **Technical Experiments**: Used to compare, validate, or refine solution design and implementation decisions. Focused on how things work, not just what people think or do. For example, A/B tests, micro-validations, component trials, usability checks, feature verification

## 7. Knowledge Updating

- What do you now know?
- How confident are you? Why?
- What assumptions did you update or abandon?

## 8. Next Steps

- What are you doing next based on this experiment?
