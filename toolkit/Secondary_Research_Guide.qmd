Secondary research helps you explore what is *already known* about your community, market, and competitors.  Use it to avoid rediscovering basics, sharpen your primary exploration, and ground your insights in broader context.

## What to Search For
- **Customer insights**: demographics, psychographics, behaviors, usage patterns.  
- **Market analysis**: market size, growth rates, adoption trends.  
- **Competitor analysis**: existing players, their models, strengths, and gaps.  
- **Industry & environment trends**: technology, regulation, cultural shifts, economics.  

## Where to Look
- **Free and open sources**:  
  - Government portals (e.g., census, labor data, trade stats)  
  - Google Trends, social media trend tools  
  - World Bank, OECD, NGO/think tank reports  
  - Business press and consulting firm white papers  

- **Paid / institutional sources**:  
  - Mintel, Euromonitor, IBISWorld, Factiva  
  - Industry associations  
  - University library databases (e.g., BYU innovation database index)  

## How to Use It
- **Start here**: scan secondary sources before entering the field.  
- **Triangulate**: compare published findings with conversations and observations.  
- **Treat as experiments**: ask *“If I search here, what will I learn?”*  
- **Track surprises and absences**: sometimes missing data is as telling as what you find.

*Success measure*: When your secondary research confirms or challenges your field discoveries and prevents wasted interviews on what is already known.
