# Primary Experiment Template {.unnumbered}

#### Use this template to conduct the primary experiment represented by a complete diamond {.subtitle} 

## Primary Experiments

Each primary experiment is one diamond in the triple diamond framework.  The primary experiments are

- People access
- Pain validation
- Solution validation and testing with prototypes

> Every **Supporting Experiment** should be linked in your **Primary Experiment** document and tracked in your **Experiment Log Tracker**.
> 
> * **Primary Experiment Template** documents your full inquiry into expeditionary innovation unknowns. It will often include multiple forms of data collection and synthesis over time.\
> * **Supporting Experiment Template** documents each individual exploratory, confirmatory, or technical experiment. These are the building blocks that generate evidence, insight, or surprise.

## General Info
- **Title**: [Descriptive Name]\
- **Date(s)**:\
- **Team Members Involved**:

## 1.  Clarify the Unknown
- **Most Urgent Unknown**: What uncertainty are you trying to reduce?
- **Other Urgent Unknowns**: Why is this one most pressing?

## 2. Modalities and Data Sources
- **Modalities Used** (e.g., Interviews, Observations, Social Media, etc.):
- **Supporting Experiment Logs**: (Link to supporting experiment docs)
- **Why this mix?** What makes this combination appropriate for the unknown?

## 3. Synthesis of Design and Implementation
- What kinds of people or data sources were targeted?
- Sampling challenges or bias concerns?
- Key notes across different collection types?

## 4. Summary of Results and Patterns
- Summarize major insights, themes, or findings
- Were there convergences or contradictions?
- Refer to **supporting experiment docs** for detail

## 5. Knowledge Updating
- What do you now believe more strongly?
- What surprised you?
- How confident are you? Why?
- Did this lead to a new hypothesis, persona, need statement, or opportunity?

## 6. Next Steps
- What follow-up experiment or decision does this point to?
