# Survey Guide {#sec-survey-guide .unnumbered} 

This guide should be used with the methods outlined in the @sec-surveys-section section of [Chapter @sec-explore-community-chapter].

Surveys are not just questionnaires — they are **structured experiments in convergence**.  
They work best after you’ve uncovered pains through conversations and observation, helping you measure **how widespread** frustrations are and **which matter most**.

---

## When to Use

- To **validate and rank** insights from conversations or observations.  
- To measure **prevalence** of pains across a population.  
- To reach groups you cannot easily interview or observe.  

---

## Design Principles

- **Keep it short** — 5–10 focused questions.  
- **Ask about past and present**, not hypotheticals or future desires.  
- Use **ranking or rating scales** (e.g., “Which was hardest?” or “Rate the difficulty from 1–5”).  
- Add **one or two open-ended prompts** (e.g., “What’s the hardest part of X?”).  
- **Pilot test** on a few respondents to catch bias or confusion.  

---

## Common Mistakes

- Too long (fatigue → bad data).  
- Product-centric (“Would you buy this?”).  
- Future-focused (“Would you want a tool that…”).  
- Leading or loaded questions.  

---

## Success Signal

Your survey has done its job when it:  

- Clarifies which pains matter most.  
- Reveals how widespread they are.  
- Helps you prioritize **which hypotheses to test next**.
