# Role Play Guide {#sec-role-play-guide .unnumbered} 

This guide should be used with the methods outlined in the @sec-role-play-section section of [Chapter @sec-explore-community-chapter].

Role play lets you step into your customer’s shoes and act out their experience. It surfaces pain points, emotions, and breakdowns you might not see from the outside.

## When to Use
- To simulate tasks or situations where direct observation isn’t possible.
- To explore how customers might feel using a new process, product, or service.
- To test for friction points in journeys before building solutions.

## Setup
1. **Define the Scenario**: What situation are you reenacting? (“Ordering lunch through a delivery app,” “navigating the airport with a stroller,” etc.).
2. **Assign Roles**: Someone acts as the customer, others as staff, systems, or obstacles.
3. **Gather Props**: Use physical stand-ins (phone, chair, bag, sticky notes) to make it real.
4. **Clarify Goals**: What do you hope to learn? Pain points? Emotions? Workarounds?

## Running the Role Play
- **Act It Out**: Walk through the task as realistically as possible. Stay in character.
- **Narrate Feelings**:– Pause to voice what the “customer” feels (“This step feels confusing.”).
- **Iterate**: Replay with variations (different personas, contexts, or constraints).
- **Observe & Record**: Note where frustration, delay, or improvisation appears.

## Key Questions
- Where did confusion, hesitation, or frustration occur?
- What emotions surfaced (stress, delight, boredom)?
- Which workarounds did the “customer” invent?
- What surprised you compared to your expectations?

**Common Confusion:**  

- It’s not acting class — the goal is empathy, not performance.
- Don’t design solutions yet — focus on experiencing the pain, not fixing it.
- Props don’t have to be perfect — rough stand-ins are enough to trigger insight.
:::

## Afterward
- Debrief as a team — What did we learn? What new hypotheses emerged?
- Compare with real observations — do the pains match what customers actually experience?
- Capture quotes, sketches, and surprises immediately before memory fades.
