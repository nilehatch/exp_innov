# People Divergence Sprint {#sec-people-divergence-guide .unnumbered}

<!-- Generate a wide set of communities with early access signals -->

#### A 45–90 minute exercise to map candidate communities before you choose {.subtitle}

> Goal: produce a *shortlist* of plausible communities (10–30), each with a clear description, why-they-might-hurt, and at least one **access channel** to verify next.

---

## Materials & Setup {.unnumbered}
- Sticky notes or a shared doc/board  
- Timer (phone is fine)  
- This guide + the **Diverge** chapter for context  
- Team of 2–5 (solo works too; halve the timers)

::: callout-tip
**Timebox:** If you only have 45 minutes, use the “Quick Mode” timings in each step.
:::

---

## Step 1 — Anchor a Problem Space (5–10 min) {.unnumbered}
Write one **plain-language** statement:

**Anchor:** “We’re exploring friction around ___ for ___ in ___ context.”

Examples:
- “Safety during the *walking segments* of commutes for *women* in *urban areas*.”
- “Care coordination for *adult children* supporting *aging parents* across *states*.”

::: callout-warning
Avoid solution words (“app,” “platform,” “AI”) in the anchor.
:::


## Step 2 — Generate Communities (10–20 min) {.unnumbered}
Silent brainstorm first (3–5 min), then round-robin share. Aim for **quantity** (20+). Use these **stretch prompts**:

- Who experiences this most **intensely**?
- Who is **ignored** by current solutions?
- Who has **workarounds** no one sees?
- Who faces this at **odd times/places** (night shift, rural routes, transfer points)?
- Who’s adjacent (caregivers, gatekeepers, frontline workers, volunteers)?

**Quick Mode:** 8–10 minutes total; shoot for 12–15 groups.


## Step 3 — Add Texture (8–15 min) {.unnumbered}
For each promising group, sketch a one-liner **profile**: role + situation + friction.

**Template:**  
“**[Group]** who **[do X / live in Y]** often **[friction]** because **[why].**”

Examples:
- “**Professional women** who walk from subway to office often **avoid side streets** because **lighting is inconsistent and foot traffic thins.**”
- “**Night-shift nurses** crossing hospital lots **carry keys visible** because **security patrols are sparse at 3am.**”


## Step 4 — Map an Orbit (6–10 min) {.unnumbered}
Name 1–3 **orbit roles** per group (people who influence or constrain the experience): e.g., property managers, transit security, roommates, HR, campus police, rideshare drivers, subreddit mods.

::: callout-note
Orbit roles become **access multipliers** and reveal hidden constraints you’ll test later.
:::


## Step 5 — Capture Light Access Signals (8–12 min) {.unnumbered}
For each group, jot at least **one plausible channel** where you could reach them in the next week:

- Physical: specific stations, entrances/exits, bus stops, gyms, dorms, employer lobbies
- Digital: subreddit, Slack/Discord, alumni groups, HOA/Nextdoor, Meetup, church/ward groups
- Warm routes: student clubs, coworking spaces, HR newsletters, union/local boards

**Rule:** If you can’t imagine where they are *and* how to approach, mark **LOW** access.


## Step 6 — Snapshot & Shortlist (5–10 min) {.unnumbered}
Create a **one-screen** table you can revisit in Converge:

| Group label | One-line profile | Orbit roles | Likely access channels | Access (LOW/MED/HIGH) | Why this group might hurt |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Women walking part of commute | Subway → office walkers avoid side streets after dark | Roommates, property mgr, transit security | Station exits, coworking list, r/nyc | MED | Lighting, sparsity, vigilance load |
| Night-shift nurses | 3am lot crossing w/ fatigue | Hospital security, supervisors | Staff Slack, union board | LOW | Distance, staffing patterns |
| Female grad students | Campus-to-housing late | Roommates, campus police | Grad Slack, dept admins | HIGH | Staggered hours, low-cost routes |

Keep 10–30 rows; you’ll down-select in the next chapter.


## Quick Bias Check (2–4 min) {.unnumbered}
- Are most groups **people like us** or **easy to reach**? Add three that aren’t.  
- Did we include at least one **non-obvious** subgroup (e.g., transfers, caregivers, gig workers)?


## Done = “Diverge Complete” When… {.unnumbered}
- You have **10–30** candidate communities with one-line profiles  
- Each has ≥1 **realistic access channel** (even if tentative)  
- Orbit roles are noted for at least your top 8–10 candidates


## Field Sheet (Copy/Paste) {.unnumbered}

Anchor:
We’re exploring friction around ______________________ for ________________ in ______________.

Candidate groups (aim 20+):
1) ___________________________
2) ___________________________
3) ___________________________
...

One-line profiles (pick 10–30 to flesh out):
- [Group] who [do/live] often [friction] because [why].
- [Group] who [do/live] often [friction] because [why].
...

Orbit roles (1–3 each):
- [Group]: ___________________
- [Group]: ___________________

Access channels (at least one per group):
- [Group]: ___________________

Bias check adds (3 non-obvious):
- ___________________________
- ___________________________
- ___________________________


## What to Save to Your Data Room {.unnumbered}
- This guide + a dated sprint doc (export to PDF/PNG if you used a board)  
- The **shortlist table** (CSV/Sheet) for the Converge chapter  
- Any contact lists or channel links you surfaced (for Access Test later)
