Failing early and cheaply is better than failing late and expensively. But failure shouldn’t be your primary learning strategy.\n\nThe primary challenge isn’t failure. It’s **uncertainty**.  You're operating in a fog because \n\n- you don’t know who your real customer is,\n- what they truly need,\n- or what solution will make them say “*yes*.”\n\nMost entrepreneurs try to navigate that fog by guessing. They launch on hunches, pivot when results disappoint, and keep iterating, hoping to bump into the answer by accident. It’s a painful, expensive way to learn.\n\nThere *is* a better way: a process that lets you move forward without pretending you know more than you do — one step at a time, always knowing the next move. You don’t have to love uncertainty to succeed as an entrepreneur; you just have to commit to a process that steadily reduces it.\n\nThis book is about that process.\n\n<!--\n## Why So Many Good Ideas Still Fail {.unnumbered}\n\nYou’ve heard it before: *fail fast*. Sure — failing early is better than failing late. But failure isn’t the real problem.\n\nThe real problem is **uncertainty**.\n\nMost startups launch without clear answers to three questions:  \n- Who is our customer?  \n- What do they really need?  \n- What solution will make them say *yes*?  \n\nWhen those answers aren’t known, guessing takes over. Some guess through “build, test, pivot, repeat” cycles. Others tinker endlessly. Either way, the odds of hitting the target by accident are slim.\n\nYou don’t have to gamble. You don’t have to love uncertainty, either. There’s a process that cuts through the fog — helping you learn what matters most before you launch. That’s what this book is about.\n-->\n\n## What Expeditionary Innovation Is — and Isn’t {.unnumbered}\n\nThe word *expedition* comes from the Latin *ex* (out) and *ped* (foot) — to stride out, to remove obstacles, to move with purpose. Expeditionary innovation is just that: a journey into the unknown with a clear aim, where each step clears the way for the next. It’s not wandering without a map; it’s advancing into unfamiliar territory with the right tools, the right questions, and the determination to come back with something of value.\n\nBecause the term “innovation” gets used for almost everything, it’s worth clarifying what we mean — and what we don’t. Expeditionary innovation is not:\n\n-   an **execution-driven small business** that thrives by doing something already known, better or cheaper.\n-   a **high-tech arms race** aimed at beating incumbents through engineering firepower.\n-   **university-led frontier research**, extending the frontiers of human knowledge through the work of scientists at the boundaries.\n\nAs we see in @tbl-innovation-typology, expeditionary innovation is its own creature. It starts with an **unknown, unmet need** — one that almost always exists — often hidden at the fringes where incumbents don’t look. It’s a need that real people feel every day, but that no one has yet recognized, written down, or started working to solve. It’s about going into the field, surfacing those needs, and designing solutions that serve them so well they can’t help but say “yes.”\n\nThat’s why it works for people who don’t think of themselves as especially “creative.” Follow the process and you’ll look like one of the most creative entrepreneurs in the room — not because you guessed right, but because you discovered a need that others missed.\n\nLater in the book, we’ll look at how this same process can lead to big opportunities, even unicorn-scale ones, and why it naturally produces the kind of disruptive innovations that incumbents avoid until it’s too late. But first, you need to see it for what it is: *a different category of innovation with its own rules, its own mindset, and its own extraordinary reliability*.\n\n\n<!--\n:::{#tbl-typology tbl-cap=\"Typology of innovation categories including **expeditionary innovation** where customer needs are initially unknown\" tbl-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n<table class=\"innovation-typology-table\">\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"col\"></th> \n    <th scope=\"col\">Known solution</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Unknown solution<br>(within reach)</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Unknown solution<br>(beyond reach)</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">Known<br>customer<br>need</th>\n    <td>Execution-driven small business</td>\n    <td>High-tech arms race</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">University-led frontier research</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">Unknown<br>customer<br>need</th>\n    <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"expeditionary\">Expeditionary innovation</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n:::\n-->\n\n![Typology of innovation categories including **expeditionary innovation** where customer needs are initially unknown](images/innov_typology_4.svg){#tbl-innovation-typology fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n## Why This Works So Reliably {.unnumbered}\n\nMost innovation advice quietly assumes that real opportunities are rare — that creativity depends on lucky sparks or sudden genius. In reality, unmet needs are everywhere.\n\nMarkets naturally push companies toward the center. Over time, competitors converge on the largest concentration of mainstream customers, piling features and prices into the same crowded peak. That leaves those at the edges underserved. They adapt with workarounds, compromises, or “good enough” solutions that never truly fit.\n\nThese edge customers suffer under what we call the *tyranny of the market*: they’re visible enough to buy, but not valuable enough for incumbents to design for. Their needs remain invisible in analyst reports, investor decks, and strategy slides. And yet, those unmet needs are where new opportunities live.[^1] \n\n[^1]: With expeditionary innovation, your solutions naturally fit the pattern of *disruptive innovation* as defined and popularized by Clayton Christensen and Michael Raynor, with you starting in a niche that incumbents dismiss, then growing into something that reshapes the market.You can read more about these influential concepts in *The Innovator's Dilemma* [@christensen1997innovator] and *The Innovator's Solution* [@christensen2003innovator].\n\n\nWhen you learn to see and serve these overlooked edges, you often enter a space with no direct competition. Because your solution fits “exactly right,” the people you help become your most loyal advocates from the start.\n\nWe’ll return to this idea in detail — including a visual of how mainstream competitors cluster and leave the edges underserved — in [Figure @fig-tyranny-market] in the **Choosing Your People** part.\n\n## Finding the Edges {.unnumbered}\n\nHow do you spot these hidden opportunities? By paying attention to signals most companies ignore.\n\nLook for people who don’t fit the mold.\n\n-  cobbling together multiple products just to make things work,\n- inventing hacks or awkward routines to get by,\n- buying “close enough” but never “just right.”\n\nListen for pain hiding in plain sight:\n\n- complaints that keep resurfacing in forums or reviews,\n- sharp frustrations tucked inside otherwise positive feedback,\n- stories of delay, confusion, or vulnerability brushed off as “just part of it.”\n\nThe temptation will always be to round your idea back toward the middle. Resist it. The fit that feels “too specific” is usually the one that matters most.\n\n\n\n## From Edge to Innovation: The Triple Diamond Framework {.unnumbered}\n\nThe Expeditionary Innovation process is built around a **three-diamond innovation framework** — an extended version of the well-known “double diamond” model[^2] — that guides innovators from initial uncertainty to validated opportunity. Each diamond represents a distinct phase of structured work, alternating between **divergent exploration** and **convergent decision-making**.\n\n[^2]: The triple diamond extends the well-known double diamond model popularized by the UK Design Council, which organizes innovation into two cycles of divergence and convergence: defining the problem and developing the solution. Expeditionary innovation adds a first diamond—choosing the right people—because starting with the wrong group undermines the entire process.\n\n![The triple diamond framework for expeditionary innovation. Explore to gain insight, generate informed hypotheses, and test the hypotheses about your people, their needs, and your solution.](images/10_triple_diamond.svg){#fig-triple-diamond fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Diamond 1: Choose the Right People\n\nInnovation begins not with an idea, but with *people*.\\\nIn this phase, you diverge by exploring a wide range of potential customers or user groups. Using structured criteria, you then converge on one group to study in depth. Finally, you run an **access test** to confirm you can reach them in meaningful numbers.\n\nThis decision is foundational: everything that follows will be shaped by *who* you choose to serve.\n\nBy the end of this diamond, you should have **evidence of access** to a specific group you can reliably reach and engage.\n\n![Choose a target population and validate that you have access](images/21_people_diamond_test.svg){#fig-people-diamond style=\"max-height: 340px;\" fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Diamond 2: Understand an Unmet Need\n\nThis phase is where **exploratory experiments** become the engine of discovery.\n\n#### What Are Exploratory Experiments?\n\nExploratory experiments are open-ended, discovery-oriented investigations.[^3] Rather than starting with a fully formed hypothesis, you begin with curiosity and uncertainty — using field observations, conversations, and other immersion methods to *find out what you don’t yet know*.\\\nThey are designed to: \n\n- Surface unmet needs that customers may not articulate directly. \n- Identify patterns and anomalies in customer behavior or context. \n- Generate new questions and possibilities, rather than simply confirming assumptions.\n\n[^3]: The philosopher of science Ian Hacking [-@hacking2006emergence] calls this mode of inquiry “adventure” — experiments that precede theory, inviting a guess at what might happen before seeing what will happen. While most experiments in science have historically been confirmatory, exploratory experiments are now recognized as a distinct and essential category [@steinle1997entering; @steinle2002experiments; @burian2007microrna].\n\n#### How They Fit the Process\n\nIn Diamond 2, exploratory experiments help you systematically navigate ambiguity: \n\n- **Diverge**: Immerse yourself in the world of your chosen people through ethnographic tools — observation, conversation, shadowing, and reflection. \n- **Converge**: Use thematic analysis, persona building, and journey mapping to make sense of what you’ve learned. \n- **Test Early**: Form a *pain hypothesis* — a testable claim about an unmet need — and run a **pain validation test** to see if the problem is both real and significant.\n\nBy the end of this diamond, you should have a **validated solution concept** and **prototype evidence** that customers will buy.\n\n![Discover an unknown, unmet need and validate that your people have the need](images/22_pain_diamond_test.svg){#fig-pain-diamond fig-align=\"center\" style=\"max-height: 340px;\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Diamond 3: Build the Right Solution\n\nWith a validated problem in hand, you can now move quickly through solution generation and confirmatory testing: \n\n- **Diverge**: Generate a wide range of ideas (aim for 100+ possibilities using rapid ideation tools). \n- **Converge**: Apply feasibility filters, dot voting, and scoring matrices to identify the most promising concept. \n- **Stack Confirmatory Tests**: Run a progression of tests — desirability, usability, viability — culminating in a smoke test and profit analytics.\n\nHere, confirmatory experiments dominate. Their role is to validate that your chosen solution not only works, but works *for the right people*, *solves the right problem*, and is *worth building at scale*.\n\nBy the end of this diamond, you should have a **validated solution concept** and prototypes that confirm that you can solve customer needs and they will buy it.\n\n![Discover an elegant solution to the customer need, verify that you can build it, and validate that customers want it](images/23_solution_diamond_test.svg){#fig-solution-diamond style=\"max-height: 340px;\" fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Why This Sequence Matters\n\nBy embedding exploratory experiments in each diamond, Expeditionary Innovation ensures that: \n\n- **Hypotheses are well-informed** before testing begins. \n- **Resources are spent wisely** — no building before validation. \n- **Uncertainty becomes opportunity**, as early ambiguity drives deeper understanding rather than hasty decision-making.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion: Begin the Expedition {.unnumbered}\n\nThe journey from edge to evidence isn’t a straight line. With the triple diamond, you can navigate it with purpose, discipline, and confidence — from choosing the right people, to discovering and validating an unmet need, to designing and testing a solution that works.\n\nFollow this process and you’ll create innovations that truly delight your customers. They’ll gladly pay for a solution no one else offers, become loyal advocates, and by addressing a need no one else has spotted, you’ll have a natural window of time to establish your foothold before the rest of the market reacts.\n\nMost importantly, by resisting intuitive but low‑probability methods, you dramatically improve your odds of success. You can mostly eliminate product–market-fit risk — often the dominant risk in startups.\n\nBegin your expedition. Follow the process to create create for your customers and for yourself with confidence from the very first step..\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["base.css","custom.css"],"number-sections":true,"output-file":"Expeditionary_Innovation.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
