Failing early and cheaply is better than failing late and expensively. But failure shouldn’t be your primary learning strategy.\n\nThe primary challenge isn’t failure. It’s **uncertainty**.  You're operating in a fog because \n\n- you don’t know who your real customer is,\n- what they truly need,\n- or what solution will make them say “*yes*.”\n\nMost entrepreneurs try to navigate that fog by guessing. They launch on hunches, pivot when results disappoint, and keep iterating, hoping to bump into the answer by accident. It’s a painful, expensive way to learn.\n\nThere *is* a better way: a process that lets you move forward without pretending you know more than you do — one step at a time, always knowing the next move. You don’t have to love uncertainty to succeed as an entrepreneur; you just have to commit to a process that steadily reduces it.\n\nThis book is about that process.\n\n```{=html}\n<!--\n## Why So Many Good Ideas Still Fail {.unnumbered}\n\nYou’ve heard it before: *fail fast*. Sure — failing early is better than failing late. But failure isn’t the real problem.\n\nThe real problem is **uncertainty**.\n\nMost startups launch without clear answers to three questions:  \n- Who is our customer?  \n- What do they really need?  \n- What solution will make them say *yes*?  \n\nWhen those answers aren’t known, guessing takes over. Some guess through “build, test, pivot, repeat” cycles. Others tinker endlessly. Either way, the odds of hitting the target by accident are slim.\n\nYou don’t have to gamble. You don’t have to love uncertainty, either. There’s a process that cuts through the fog — helping you learn what matters most before you launch. That’s what this book is about.\n-->\n```\n\n## What Expeditionary Innovation Is — and Isn’t {.unnumbered}\n\nThe word *expedition* comes from the Latin *ex* (out) and *ped* (foot) — to stride out, to remove obstacles, to move with purpose. Expeditionary innovation is just that: a journey into the unknown with a clear aim, where each step clears the way for the next. It’s not wandering without a map; it’s advancing into unfamiliar territory with the right tools, the right questions, and the determination to come back with something of value.\n\nBecause the term “innovation” gets used for almost everything, it’s worth clarifying what we mean — and what we don’t. Expeditionary innovation is not:\n\n-   an **execution-driven small business** that thrives by doing something already known, better or cheaper.\n-   a **high-tech arms race** aimed at beating incumbents through engineering firepower.\n-   **university-led frontier research**, extending the frontiers of human knowledge through the work of scientists at the boundaries.\n\nAs we seen in @tbl-typology, expeditionary innovation is its own creature. It starts with an **unknown, unmet need** — one that almost always exists — often hidden at the fringes where incumbents don’t look. It’s a need that real people feel every day, but that no one has yet recognized, written down, or started working to solve. It’s about going into the field, surfacing those needs, and designing solutions that serve them so well they can’t help but say “yes.”\n\nThat’s why it works for people who don’t think of themselves as especially “creative.” Follow the process and you’ll look like one of the most creative entrepreneurs in the room — not because you guessed right, but because you discovered a need that others missed.\n\nLater in the book, we’ll look at how this same process can lead to big opportunities, even unicorn-scale ones, and why it naturally produces the kind of disruptive innovations that incumbents avoid until it’s too late. But first, you need to see it for what it is: *a different category of innovation with its own rules, its own mindset, and its own extraordinary reliability*.\n\n\n\n:::{#tbl-typology tbl-cap=\"Typology of innovation categories including **expeditionary innovation** where customer needs are initially unknown\" tbl-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n<!-- Table content -->\n<table class=\"innovation-typology-table\">\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"col\"></th> <!-- Blank cell for the row header, no border -->\n    <th scope=\"col\">Known solution</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Unknown solution<br>(within reach)</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Unknown solution<br>(beyond reach)</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">Known<br>customer<br>need</th>\n    <td>Execution-driven small business</td>\n    <td>High-tech arms race</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">University-led frontier research</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">Unknown<br>customer<br>need</th>\n    <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"expeditionary\">Expeditionary innovation</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n:::\n\n\n## Why This Works So Reliably {.unnumbered}\n\nMost innovation advice quietly assumes that real opportunities are rare — that creativity is a matter of lucky sparks or sudden genius. In reality, the landscape is full of unmet needs. Many are hiding in plain sight.\n\nMarkets tend to pull competitors toward the center. Over time, incumbents cluster around the largest concentration of customers — features and prices converging, everyone chasing what the mainstream customer seems to want — leaving those at the edges underserved. Fringe customers live in the gaps between what’s offered and what they truly need.\n\nThese edge customers suffer under the *tyranny of the market* where their choices are never quite right. They make do with workarounds, compromises, and awkward fits. They buy “good enough” or go without because no one has bothered to make “exactly right” — and they quietly adapt their lives around the compromises. That’s why you won’t find these needs in analyst reports or industry slides. They live in the blind spots, invisible to companies content to fight over the middle.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-tyranny-market\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| fig-align: right\n#| fig-cap-location: margin\n#| fig-cap: In many markets, competitors converge on the largest customer segment, leaving fringe needs unmet.

The shaded blue edges mark underserved customers — often invisible to incumbents — where fresh opportunities await.\n\nWhen you learn to see these overlooked needs — and design a solution that truly fits — you step into a space with no direct competition. And because you’re solving a problem that matters deeply to real people, they become your most loyal advocates from the start.\n\nHere’s the hidden bonus: solving a small, urgent need for one group often leads to bigger opportunities. Nearby groups may share similar needs, and solutions can expand, adapt, or cascade into much larger markets. This is how unicorn-scale ventures quietly emerge — not from chasing the biggest market first, but from getting something exactly right for the first group you serve.\n\nThe edges you explore are often ignored for cost or complexity reasons. With expeditionary innovation, your solutions naturally fit the pattern of *disruptive innovation* as defined by Clayton Christensen[^1] with you starting in a niche incumbents dismiss, then growing into something that reshapes the market.\n\n[^1]: Clayton Christensen and Michael Raynor have defined and popularized disruptive innovation.  You can read more about these influential concepts in *The Innovator's Dilemma* [@christensen1997innovator] and *The Innovator's Solution* [@christensen2003innovator].\n\nThis isn’t magic, luck, or a rare gift. It’s a repeatable way to discover, design, and scale innovations — and it works because the edges are always there, waiting to be explored.\n\n<!-- In most markets, competitors fight for the middle — leaving edge customers under the tyranny of the market: plenty of choices, all a little bit wrong. Expeditionary innovation starts here. -->\n\n## Finding the Edges {.unnumbered}\n\nOnce you know where opportunity hides, the challenge becomes learning to see it. The edges don’t announce themselves. They blend into the background of the mainstream — disguised as “niche markets” too small to bother with, customer complaints shrugged off as outliers, or awkward workarounds people have quietly accepted as normal.\n\n**Start with the people who don’t fit the mold.** Look for customers whose needs push them outside the sweet spot the industry serves. You’ll find them:\n\n-   Adapting mainstream products in creative ways just to make them usable.\n-   Buying multiple solutions and cobbling them together into something functional.\n-   Paying for extra steps, labor, or accessories because nothing fits “right” out of the box.\n\n**Listen for pain hiding in plain sight.** It often surfaces in:\n\n-   Support tickets or forum threads that keep resurfacing but never get resolved.\n-   Product reviews that praise the product overall but carry a sharp, specific frustration.\n-   Industries where analysts talk about the “average customer” and skip the messy edge cases.\n\n**Resist the pull toward the middle.** Once you spot an underserved edge, the temptation will be to “round off” your idea so it can appeal to more people. That’s the trap incumbents fall into — diluting the fit until it’s just another compromise. In expeditionary innovation, your first aim is *exact fit* for a small group, not broad fit for a big one.\n\nThe real skill is not guessing where the edge is, but *proving it*. That’s where exploratory experiments come in — simple, low-cost tests designed to uncover whether the problem is real, urgent, and worth solving. Done well, they transform vague hunches into clear opportunities with loyal early adopters already waiting.\n\n## From Edge to Innovation: The Triple Diamond Framework {.unnumbered}\n\nThe Expeditionary Innovation process is built around a **three-diamond innovation framework** — an extended version of the well-known “double diamond” model[^2] — that guides innovators from initial uncertainty to validated opportunity. Each diamond represents a distinct phase of structured work, alternating between **divergent exploration** and **convergent decision-making**.\n\n[^2]: The triple diamond extends the well-known double diamond model popularized by the UK Design Council, which organizes innovation into two cycles of divergence and convergence: defining the problem and developing the solution. Expeditionary innovation adds a first diamond—choosing the right people—because starting with the wrong group undermines the entire process.\n\n![The triple diamond framework for expeditionary innovation. Explore to gain insight, generate informed hypotheses, and test the hypotheses about your people, their needs, and your solution.](images/10_triple_diamond.png){#fig-triple-diamond fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Diamond 1: Choose the Right People\n\nInnovation begins not with an idea, but with *people*.\\\nIn this phase, you diverge by exploring a wide range of potential customers or user groups. Using structured criteria, you then converge on one group to study in depth. Finally, you run an **access test** to confirm you can reach them in meaningful numbers.\n\nThis decision is foundational: everything that follows will be shaped by *who* you choose to serve.\n\nBy the end of this diamond, you should have **evidence of access** to a specific group you can reliably reach and engage.\n\n![Choose a target population and validate that you have access](images/21_people_diamond_test.png){#fig-people-diamond fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Diamond 2: Understand an Unmet Need\n\nThis phase is where **exploratory experiments** become the engine of discovery.\n\n#### What Are Exploratory Experiments?\n\nExploratory experiments are open-ended, discovery-oriented investigations.[^3] Rather than starting with a fully formed hypothesis, you begin with curiosity and uncertainty — using field observations, conversations, and other immersion methods to *find out what you don’t yet know*.\\\nThey are designed to: \n\n- Surface unmet needs that customers may not articulate directly. \n- Identify patterns and anomalies in customer behavior or context. \n- Generate new questions and possibilities, rather than simply confirming assumptions.\n\n[^3]: The philosopher of science Ian Hacking [-@hacking2006emergence] calls this mode of inquiry “adventure” — experiments that precede theory, inviting a guess at what might happen before seeing what will happen. While most experiments in science have historically been confirmatory, exploratory experiments are now recognized as a distinct and essential category [@steinle1997entering; @steinle2002experiments; @burian2007microrna].\n\n#### How They Fit the Process\n\nIn Diamond 2, exploratory experiments help you systematically navigate ambiguity: \n\n- **Diverge**: Immerse yourself in the world of your chosen people through ethnographic tools — observation, conversation, shadowing, and reflection. \n- **Converge**: Use thematic analysis, persona building, and journey mapping to make sense of what you’ve learned. \n- **Test Early**: Form a *pain hypothesis* — a testable claim about an unmet need — and run a **pain validation test** to see if the problem is both real and significant.\n\nBy the end of this diamond, you should have a **validated solution concept** and **prototype evidence** that customers will buy.\n\n![Discover an unknown, unmet need and validate that your people have the need](images/22_pain_diamond_test.png){#fig-pain-diamond fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Diamond 3: Build the Right Solution\n\nWith a validated problem in hand, you can now move quickly through solution generation and confirmatory testing: \n\n- **Diverge**: Generate a wide range of ideas (aim for 100+ possibilities using rapid ideation tools). \n- **Converge**: Apply feasibility filters, dot voting, and scoring matrices to identify the most promising concept. \n- **Stack Confirmatory Tests**: Run a progression of tests — desirability, usability, viability — culminating in a smoke test and profit analytics.\n\nHere, confirmatory experiments dominate. Their role is to validate that your chosen solution not only works, but works *for the right people*, *solves the right problem*, and is *worth building at scale*.\n\nBy the end of this diamond, you should have a solution concept and prototypes that you have confirmed that it solves customer needs and they will buy it.\n\n![Discover an elegant solution to the customer need, verify that you can build it, and validate that customers want it](images/23_solution_diamond_test.png){#fig-solution-diamond fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Why This Sequence Matters\n\nBy embedding exploratory experiments in each diamond, Expeditionary Innovation ensures that: \n\n- **Hypotheses are well-informed** before testing begins. \n- **Resources are spent wisely** — no building before validation. \n- **Uncertainty becomes opportunity**, as early ambiguity drives deeper understanding rather than hasty decision-making.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion: Begin the Expedition {.unnumbered}\n\nThe journey from edge to evidence isn’t a straight line. With the triple diamond, you can navigate it with purpose, discipline, and confidence — from choosing the right people, to discovering and validating an unmet need, to designing and testing a solution that works.\n\nFollow this process and you’ll create innovations that truly delight your customers. They’ll gladly pay for a solution no one else offers, become loyal advocates, and by addressing a need no one else has spotted, you’ll have a natural window of time to establish your foothold before the rest of the market reacts.\n\nMost importantly, by resisting intuitive but low‑probability methods, you dramatically improve your odds of success. You can address product–market fit risk — often the dominant risk in startups — with a high degree of confidence.\n\nBegin your expedition. Follow the process — not a script — and discover the value you can create for your customers and for yourself.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<style>\n/* ---------------------------------------------------\n   Quick, contained style sandbox for this mock file\n   (safe to paste into a single .qmd while comparing)\n   --------------------------------------------------- */\n\n/* Fallback palette in case custom.css isn't loaded */\n:root {\n  --ei-primary: #3774B7;\n  --ei-primary-dark: #24548A;\n  --ei-primary-tint: #E8F0FA;\n  --ei-text: #1F2937;\n  --ei-muted: #6B7280;\n}\n\n/* Shared hero utilities */\n.hero-wrap {\n  margin: 1.25rem 0 2rem 0;\n  border-radius: 14px;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  box-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.06);\n  border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.06);\n}\n.hero-inner {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 100%;\n}\n.hero-inner img {\n  display: block;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n}\n\n/* Headline used inside hero overlays */\n.hero-title {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 5%;\n  bottom: 10%;\n  color: white;\n  font-weight: 700;\n  line-height: 1.15;\n  text-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.35);\n}\n\n/* Small caption helper under each demo */\n.hero-caption {\n  font-size: 0.95rem;\n  color: var(--ei-muted);\n  margin: 0.6rem 0 1.4rem 0;\n}\n\n/* ==========================\n   1) Reduced-Height Hero\n   ========================== */\n.hero-reduced .hero-inner {\n  /* Clamp the visual height so it feels light */\n  max-height: clamp(180px, 28vw, 260px);\n}\n.hero-reduced .hero-inner img {\n  object-fit: cover;\n  height: clamp(180px, 28vw, 260px);\n}\n\n/* ==========================\n   2) Integrated Title Hero\n   (title over the image)\n   ========================== */\n.hero-integrated .hero-inner {\n  max-height: clamp(240px, 34vw, 360px);\n}\n.hero-integrated .hero-inner img {\n  object-fit: cover;\n  height: clamp(240px, 34vw, 360px);\n  filter: saturation(0.95);\n}\n.hero-integrated .hero-overlay {\n  position: absolute; inset: 0;\n  background:\n    linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(0,0,0,0.35) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 45%, rgba(0,0,0,0.45) 100%);\n}\n.hero-integrated .hero-title {\n  font-size: clamp(1.4rem, 3.5vw, 2.25rem);\n  max-width: 60ch;\n}\n\n/* ==========================\n   3) Thin Accent Banner\n   (subtle brand stripe + small art)\n   ========================== */\n.hero-accent {\n  border-radius: 10px;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.06);\n}\n.hero-accent .accent-bar {\n  height: 10px;\n  background: linear-gradient(90deg, var(--ei-primary), var(--ei-primary-dark));\n}\n.hero-accent .accent-body {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr minmax(180px, 28%);\n  gap: clamp(12px, 2vw, 24px);\n  align-items: center;\n  padding: clamp(14px, 2.6vw, 22px);\n  background: #fff;\n}\n.hero-accent .accent-text h2 {\n  margin: 0 0 0.35rem 0;\n  font-size: clamp(1.15rem, 2.5vw, 1.5rem);\n  color: var(--ei-text);\n}\n.hero-accent .accent-text p {\n  margin: 0;\n  color: var(--ei-muted);\n}\n.hero-accent .accent-art {\n  background: linear-gradient(180deg, var(--ei-primary-tint), #fff);\n  border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.06);\n  border-radius: 10px;\n  padding: clamp(6px, 1.2vw, 10px);\n}\n.hero-accent .accent-art img {\n  border-radius: 8px;\n}\n\n/* ==========================\n   4) Title Card Hero\n   (image framed in a card)\n   ========================== */\n.hero-card .card {\n  max-width: 980px;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  background: #fff;\n  border-radius: 16px;\n  border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.06);\n  box-shadow: 0 8px 22px rgba(0,0,0,0.07);\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n.hero-card .card-media {\n  background: linear-gradient(180deg, var(--ei-primary-tint), #fff);\n  padding: clamp(12px, 2.2vw, 16px);\n}\n.hero-card .card-media img {\n  border-radius: 10px;\n}\n.hero-card .card-body {\n  padding: clamp(14px, 2.6vw, 24px);\n}\n.hero-card .card-body h2 {\n  margin: 0 0 0.35rem 0;\n  font-size: clamp(1.2rem, 2.6vw, 1.6rem);\n  color: var(--ei-text);\n}\n.hero-card .card-body p {\n  margin: 0;\n  color: var(--ei-muted);\n}\n\n/* Mobile: tighten outer margins */\n@media (max-width: 640px) {\n  .hero-wrap { margin: 0.8rem 0 1.2rem 0; }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n<div class=\"hero-wrap hero-reduced\">\n  <div class=\"hero-inner\">\n     <img src=\"images/01/01-hero.svg\" alt=\"Expeditionary innovation hero art (reduced height)\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Why So Many Good Ideas Still Fail {.unnumbered}\n\nIf you’ve been in the entrepreneurial world for more than five minutes, you’ve heard the mantra: *fail fast*. Failing early and cheaply is better than failing late and expensively. But failure shouldn’t be your primary learning strategy.\n\nThe primary challenge isn’t failure. It’s **uncertainty**.

Expeditionary innovation is just that: a journey into the unknown with a clear aim, where each step clears the way for the next. It’s not wandering without a map; it’s advancing into unfamiliar territory with the right tools, the right questions, and the determination to come back with something of value.\n\nBecause the term “innovation” gets used for almost everything, it’s worth clarifying what we mean — and what we don’t. Expeditionary innovation is not:\n\n-   an **execution-driven small business** that thrives by doing something already known, better or cheaper.\n-   a **high-tech arms race** aimed at beating incumbents through engineering firepower.\n-   **university-led frontier research**, extending the frontiers of human knowledge through the work of scientists at the boundaries.\n\nAs we seen in @tbl-typology, expeditionary innovation is its own creature. It starts with an **unknown, unmet need** — one that almost always exists — often hidden at the fringes where incumbents don’t look. It’s a need that real people feel every day, but that no one has yet recognized, written down, or started working to solve. It’s about going into the field, surfacing those needs, and designing solutions that serve them so well they can’t help but say “yes.”\n\nThat’s why it works for people who don’t think of themselves as especially “creative.” Follow the process and you’ll look like one of the most creative entrepreneurs in the room — not because you guessed right, but because you discovered a need that others missed.\n\nLater in the book, we’ll look at how this same process can lead to big opportunities, even unicorn-scale ones, and why it naturally produces the kind of disruptive innovations that incumbents avoid until it’s too late. But first, you need to see it for what it is: *a different category of innovation with its own rules, its own mindset, and its own extraordinary reliability*.\n\n\n\n:::{#tbl-typology tbl-cap=\"Typology of innovation categories including **expeditionary innovation** where customer needs are initially unknown\" tbl-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n<!-- Table content -->\n<table class=\"innovation-typology-table\">\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"col\"></th> <!-- Blank cell for the row header, no border -->\n    <th scope=\"col\">Known solution</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Unknown solution<br>(within reach)</th>\n    <th scope=\"col\">Unknown solution<br>(beyond reach)</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">Known<br>customer<br>need</th>\n    <td>Execution-driven small business</td>\n    <td>High-tech arms race</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">University-led frontier research</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th scope=\"row\">Unknown<br>customer<br>need</th>\n    <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"expeditionary\">Expeditionary innovation</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n:::\n\n\n## Why This Works So Reliably {.unnumbered}\n\nMost innovation advice quietly assumes that real opportunities are rare — that creativity is a matter of lucky sparks or sudden genius. In reality, the landscape is full of unmet needs. Many are hiding in plain sight.\n\nMarkets tend to pull competitors toward the center. Over time, incumbents cluster around the largest concentration of customers — features and prices converging, everyone chasing what the mainstream customer seems to want — leaving those at the edges underserved. Fringe customers live in the gaps between what’s offered and what they truly need.\n\nThese edge customers suffer under the *tyranny of the market* where their choices are never quite right. They make do with workarounds, compromises, and awkward fits. They buy “good enough” or go without because no one has bothered to make “exactly right” — and they quietly adapt their lives around the compromises. That’s why you won’t find these needs in analyst reports or industry slides. They live in the blind spots, invisible to companies content to fight over the middle.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-tyranny-market\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| fig-align: right\n#| fig-cap-location: margin\n#| fig-cap: In many markets, competitors converge on the largest customer segment, leaving fringe needs unmet.

The shaded blue edges mark underserved customers — often invisible to incumbents — where fresh opportunities await.\n\nWhen you learn to see these overlooked needs — and design a solution that truly fits — you step into a space with no direct competition. And because you’re solving a problem that matters deeply to real people, they become your most loyal advocates from the start.\n\nHere’s the hidden bonus: solving a small, urgent need for one group often leads to bigger opportunities. Nearby groups may share similar needs, and solutions can expand, adapt, or cascade into much larger markets. This is how unicorn-scale ventures quietly emerge — not from chasing the biggest market first, but from getting something exactly right for the first group you serve.\n\nThe edges you explore are often ignored for cost or complexity reasons. With expeditionary innovation, your solutions naturally fit the pattern of *disruptive innovation* as defined by Clayton Christensen[^1] with you starting in a niche incumbents dismiss, then growing into something that reshapes the market.\n\n[^1]: Clayton Christensen and Michael Raynor have defined and popularized disruptive innovation.  You can read more about these influential concepts in *The Innovator's Dilemma* [@christensen1997innovator] and *The Innovator's Solution* [@christensen2003innovator].\n\nThis isn’t magic, luck, or a rare gift. It’s a repeatable way to discover, design, and scale innovations — and it works because the edges are always there, waiting to be explored.\n\n<!-- In most markets, competitors fight for the middle — leaving edge customers under the tyranny of the market: plenty of choices, all a little bit wrong. Expeditionary innovation starts here. -->\n\n## Finding the Edges {.unnumbered}\n\nOnce you know where opportunity hides, the challenge becomes learning to see it. The edges don’t announce themselves. They blend into the background of the mainstream — disguised as “niche markets” too small to bother with, customer complaints shrugged off as outliers, or awkward workarounds people have quietly accepted as normal.\n\n**Start with the people who don’t fit the mold.** Look for customers whose needs push them outside the sweet spot the industry serves. You’ll find them:\n\n-   Adapting mainstream products in creative ways just to make them usable.\n-   Buying multiple solutions and cobbling them together into something functional.\n-   Paying for extra steps, labor, or accessories because nothing fits “right” out of the box.\n\n**Listen for pain hiding in plain sight.** It often surfaces in:\n\n-   Support tickets or forum threads that keep resurfacing but never get resolved.\n-   Product reviews that praise the product overall but carry a sharp, specific frustration.\n-   Industries where analysts talk about the “average customer” and skip the messy edge cases.\n\n**Resist the pull toward the middle.** Once you spot an underserved edge, the temptation will be to “round off” your idea so it can appeal to more people. That’s the trap incumbents fall into — diluting the fit until it’s just another compromise. In expeditionary innovation, your first aim is *exact fit* for a small group, not broad fit for a big one.\n\nThe real skill is not guessing where the edge is, but *proving it*. That’s where exploratory experiments come in — simple, low-cost tests designed to uncover whether the problem is real, urgent, and worth solving. Done well, they transform vague hunches into clear opportunities with loyal early adopters already waiting.\n\n## From Edge to Innovation: The Triple Diamond Framework {.unnumbered}\n\nThe Expeditionary Innovation process is built around a **three-diamond innovation framework** — an extended version of the well-known “double diamond” model[^2] — that guides innovators from initial uncertainty to validated opportunity. Each diamond represents a distinct phase of structured work, alternating between **divergent exploration** and **convergent decision-making**.\n\n[^2]: The triple diamond extends the well-known double diamond model popularized by the UK Design Council, which organizes innovation into two cycles of divergence and convergence: defining the problem and developing the solution. Expeditionary innovation adds a first diamond—choosing the right people—because starting with the wrong group undermines the entire process.\n\n![The triple diamond framework for expeditionary innovation. Explore to gain insight, generate informed hypotheses, and test the hypotheses about your people, their needs, and your solution.](images/10_triple_diamond.png){#fig-triple-diamond fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Diamond 1: Choose the Right People\n\nInnovation begins not with an idea, but with *people*.\\\nIn this phase, you diverge by exploring a wide range of potential customers or user groups. Using structured criteria, you then converge on one group to study in depth. Finally, you run an **access test** to confirm you can reach them in meaningful numbers.\n\nThis decision is foundational: everything that follows will be shaped by *who* you choose to serve.\n\nBy the end of this diamond, you should have **evidence of access** to a specific group you can reliably reach and engage.\n\n![Choose a target population and validate that you have access](images/21_people_diamond_test.png){#fig-people-diamond fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Diamond 2: Understand an Unmet Need\n\nThis phase is where **exploratory experiments** become the engine of discovery.\n\n#### What Are Exploratory Experiments?\n\nExploratory experiments are open-ended, discovery-oriented investigations.[^3] Rather than starting with a fully formed hypothesis, you begin with curiosity and uncertainty — using field observations, conversations, and other immersion methods to *find out what you don’t yet know*.\\\nThey are designed to: \n\n- Surface unmet needs that customers may not articulate directly. \n- Identify patterns and anomalies in customer behavior or context. \n- Generate new questions and possibilities, rather than simply confirming assumptions.\n\n[^3]: The philosopher of science Ian Hacking [-@hacking2006emergence] calls this mode of inquiry “adventure” — experiments that precede theory, inviting a guess at what might happen before seeing what will happen. While most experiments in science have historically been confirmatory, exploratory experiments are now recognized as a distinct and essential category [@steinle1997entering; @steinle2002experiments; @burian2007microrna].\n\n#### How They Fit the Process\n\nIn Diamond 2, exploratory experiments help you systematically navigate ambiguity: \n\n- **Diverge**: Immerse yourself in the world of your chosen people through ethnographic tools — observation, conversation, shadowing, and reflection. \n- **Converge**: Use thematic analysis, persona building, and journey mapping to make sense of what you’ve learned. \n- **Test Early**: Form a *pain hypothesis* — a testable claim about an unmet need — and run a **pain validation test** to see if the problem is both real and significant.\n\nBy the end of this diamond, you should have a **validated solution concept** and **prototype evidence** that customers will buy.\n\n![Discover an unknown, unmet need and validate that your people have the need](images/22_pain_diamond_test.png){#fig-pain-diamond fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Diamond 3: Build the Right Solution\n\nWith a validated problem in hand, you can now move quickly through solution generation and confirmatory testing: \n\n- **Diverge**: Generate a wide range of ideas (aim for 100+ possibilities using rapid ideation tools). \n- **Converge**: Apply feasibility filters, dot voting, and scoring matrices to identify the most promising concept. \n- **Stack Confirmatory Tests**: Run a progression of tests — desirability, usability, viability — culminating in a smoke test and profit analytics.\n\nHere, confirmatory experiments dominate. Their role is to validate that your chosen solution not only works, but works *for the right people*, *solves the right problem*, and is *worth building at scale*.\n\nBy the end of this diamond, you should have a solution concept and prototypes that you have confirmed that it solves customer needs and they will buy it.\n\n![Discover an elegant solution to the customer need, verify that you can build it, and validate that customers want it](images/23_solution_diamond_test.png){#fig-solution-diamond fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap-location=\"margin\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Why This Sequence Matters\n\nBy embedding exploratory experiments in each diamond, Expeditionary Innovation ensures that: \n\n- **Hypotheses are well-informed** before testing begins. \n- **Resources are spent wisely** — no building before validation. \n- **Uncertainty becomes opportunity**, as early ambiguity drives deeper understanding rather than hasty decision-making.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion: Begin the Expedition {.unnumbered}\n\nThe journey from edge to evidence isn’t a straight line. With the triple diamond, you can navigate it with purpose, discipline, and confidence — from choosing the right people, to discovering and validating an unmet need, to designing and testing a solution that works.\n\nFollow this process and you’ll create innovations that truly delight your customers. They’ll gladly pay for a solution no one else offers, become loyal advocates, and by addressing a need no one else has spotted, you’ll have a natural window of time to establish your foothold before the rest of the market reacts.\n\nMost importantly, by resisting intuitive but low‑probability methods, you dramatically improve your odds of success. You can address product–market fit risk — often the dominant risk in startups — with a high degree of confidence.\n\nBegin your expedition. Follow the process — not a script — and discover the value you can create for your customers and for yourself.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<style>\n/* ---------------------------------------------------\n
