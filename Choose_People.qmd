## Converge from Possibilities to Commitment {.unnumbered}

![Convergent narrowing from many candidate groups to one chosen community of people.](images/212_people_converge.svg){.wrapfig_right_25}
After diverging to explore a wide range of potential communities, the next step is to **converge** — to move from *possibilities* to a single, well-considered choice. This is more than selecting a study group. You’re choosing the people whose needs you’ll try to understand, whose pain you’ll explore in depth, and whose problems you aim to solve.

It’s a quiet but defining decision. Everything that follows — your discoveries, your designs, even your business model — will be shaped by this choice. If you’ve done the work of divergence well, you now have multiple promising communities in view. The goal is not to pick the one you like most or the one that feels most familiar. It’s to choose the group where your insights are likely to run deepest — and your innovation most needed.


## 1. Compare: Spot Patterns and Weigh Possibilities

::: {.callout-tip title="Prompt"}
Look across your divergent shortlist. Which groups show recurring struggles, clearer friction, or patterns that seem more persistent? Which ones blur or fade as less coherent?  
:::

Fill in the table:

| Candidate Group | Recurring Frictions | Gaps in Current Solutions | Distinctiveness / Cohesion | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------|
|                 |                     |                           |                            |       |
|                 |                     |                           |                            |       |
|                 |                     |                           |                            |       |

## 2. Empathize: Notice the Emotional Pull

::: {.callout-tip title="Prompt"}
Which groups stay in your mind? Which stories linger? Which situations create a sense of urgency or injustice?  
:::


- Group that keeps resurfacing in our conversations: `___________________________`
- Why this group feels different: `___________________________________________`
- Signs of empathy pull we noticed (e.g., discomfort at leaving them unserved, desire to know more):  
  1. `__________________________________`
  2. `__________________________________`
  3. `__________________________________`

<!--  USING CSS - not quite working but not bad - more flexible than `___`
- Group that keeps resurfacing: <span class="blank blank-medium"></span>  
- Why this group feels different: <span class="blank blank-long"></span>  
- Notes: <span class="blank blank-long blank-fill"></span>  
- Thin light line: <span class="blank blank-short blank-light"></span>
- Brand-colored line: <span class="blank blank-medium blank-brand"></span>
-->

## 3. Assess Access: Can You Actually Reach Them?

::: {.callout-tip title="Prompt"}
A powerful need you cannot access is not an opportunity. Confirm that your group is observable, reachable, and willing to engage.  
:::

Fill in the checklist for your top 2–3 groups:

| Candidate Group | Observable? (Y/N) | Reachable? (Y/N) | Willing to Engage? (Y/N) | Notes / Risks |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
|                 |                   |                  |                          |               |
|                 |                   |                  |                          |               |

If you cannot check all three boxes, your access is too weak. Either broaden your group or return to your shortlist.

## 4. Select Your People

Based on comparison, empathy, and access:

- **Chosen Group:** `___________________________________`
- **Why we chose them (patterns, empathy, access):**  
  1. `__________________________________`
  2. `__________________________________`
  3. `__________________________________`

Remember: this choice is **provisional**. Evidence may pull you toward a new definition later. But for now, this is the group you’ll commit to exploring in depth.

Use the [People Convergence Guide](toolkit/People_Converge_Guide.qmd) from the toolkit to guide your own decision-making, and review the [Halo Alert Demo](demo/exp-02-converge-worksheet.qmd) to see how another team narrowed their options and chose their people.

## Attachments (for your Data Room)

At this stage, your team should create and store artifacts in your shared data room (e.g., Google Drive, Miro, Notion). Typical attachments include:

- Comparison table (CSV or Google Sheet)  
- Empathy reflection notes (txt, journal, or whiteboard photo)  
- Access test log (doc with attempted contacts or field notes)  

Use these as a prompt. Your team’s versions will look different, and that’s expected.
