# Purpose of this Demo Part {#sec-demos-purpose}

This book teaches a **repeatable process** for reducing uncertainty and finding unmet needs.  
The **Halo Alert** demos show that process **as it actually looks in practice**‚Äîfield notes, interview transcripts, observation logs, clustering, hypotheses, and confirmatory tests‚Äîso students can trace each step and reuse the same tools on their own projects.

- **Narrative + How-to:** Every method chapter in the book explains *why* and *how*.  
  These demos show *what it looks like* when a real team does the work.
- **Linkable & modular:** Each demo stands alone, and chapters link back to the relevant toolkit guides (templates, checklists, prompts).
- **Right level of detail:** Brief vignettes for quick ideas; full transcripts where depth helps (e.g., conversations).

# What is Halo Alert? {#sec-what-halo-alert}

**Halo Alert** is a fictitious‚Äîbut realistic‚Äîproject about **reassurance and safety** for **women who walk as part of their commute** (including professional women and female university students).  
The core concept explores **discreet, low-friction ways to stay connected** (e.g., a subtle trigger that signals ‚ÄúI need you watching me now‚Äù) without escalating situations or requiring overt phone use.

> Background: The seed idea came from a student team that later disbanded; no IP is being pursued. We use the scenario here as a **teaching demo**.

# How to Use This Demo Part {#sec-how-to-use}

1. **Read the appropriat narrative chapter** first (e.g., Explore the Community, Hypthesize a Pain‚Ä¶).  
2. **Skim the matching toolkit guide** for the method (template + checklist).  
3. **Open the corresponding Halo Alert demo** to see the method *applied* (design ‚Üí execution ‚Üí evidence ‚Üí learning ‚Üí next steps).

Keep your own **data room** in parallel: copy the templates, adapt the guides, and mirror the demo structure (file naming, links, and cross-refs).

# What‚Äôs Included (Quick Map) {#sec-whats-included}

## Diamond 1 ‚Äî Choose the People
- Access exploration & outreach protocol *(stubs/placeholders as you add)*

- **Conversation method**
  - Guide adaptation: [Conversation Guide ‚Äî Halo Alert Commuters](../toolkit/conversation-guide.qmd)
  - Supporting experiments:
    - [Exp 04 ‚Äî Commuter Conversation: Sarah Thompson](exp-04-conversation-sarah-2025-02-24.qmd)

> As you add files, keep them **lowercase with dashes** (e.g., `exp-06-observation-morning-exit.qmd`) and set pretty titles inside the files.

# Conventions & Reuse {#sec-conventions}

- **Templates:** Primary & Supporting Experiment templates live in the Toolkit; each demo links back to them.  
- **Structure:** Each supporting experiment includes: *Unknown ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Evidence ‚Üí Knowledge update ‚Üí Next steps*.  
- **IDs & Links:** Use stable anchors (e.g., `#sec-conversation-guide`) for cross-refs from narrative chapters.  
- **File naming:** `exp-XX-[modality]-[short-label]-YYYY-MM-DD.qmd` (sortable, human-readable).

# Ethics & Privacy {#sec-ethics}

- **Pseudonyms** are used and personally identifying details are removed or altered.  
- **Public-space observations** avoid facial features and identifying markers; private locations require permission.  
- **Do no harm:** Avoid interventions that could escalate risk; prefer **reassurance** over confrontation.  
- **Consent:** For recorded conversations, obtain explicit permission and state your non-sales intent.

# How These Demos Connect to the Toolkit {#sec-connect-toolkit}

Every demo ties to at least one guide:

- Conversations ‚Üí see @sec-conversation-guide  
- Observation ‚Üí see @sec-observation-guide  
- Supporting/Primary Experiment templates ‚Üí Toolkit section

The intent is **traceability**: a student can jump from a technique in the narrative ‚Üí to a guide ‚Üí to a concrete Halo Alert example ‚Üí and back to their own data room with the same template.

# What to Look For (Learning Lenses) {#sec-lenses}

- **Signals of unmet need**: friction, workaround, anxiety, surprise, ‚ÄúI wish‚Ä¶‚Äù  
- **Moderators**: lighting, crowd density, time of day, route familiarity  
- **Reassurance patterns**: connection rituals (texts/ETAs), discreet triggers, route choices  
- **Decision rules**: how each experiment updates beliefs and points to the next test
