Hi [First Name] — I’m working on a student project exploring the experiences of women who commute by walking or public transit in [city].

Not selling anything — just learning from commuters’ real stories. Would you be open to a short 15–20 min chat this week about your commute?

Your perspective would be incredibly helpful. Thanks!
