# Supporting Experiment — Emily Rivera Interview {#sec-conversation-b-ha .unnumbered}

#### Following the toolkit naming conventions, this file is named `exp-04.b-conversation-emily-rivera-2025-02-25.qmd`. {.subtitle} 


## General Info
- **Title / Observation Type**: Interview with Emily Rivera, Professional Woman Commuter  
- **Date**: 2025-02-24  
- **Location / Setting**: Downtown Manhattan → Brooklyn (late evening return, ~9:30 PM)  
- **Team Member(s)**: Nile  
- **Modality**: Interview (exploratory)  
- **Linked Primary Experiment**: Diamond 2 — Pain Discovery & Validation for Professional Women Commuters

---

## 1. Clarify the Unknown
- **Most Urgent Unknown**: When and why do professional women feel least secure during commutes, and how do they manage that risk?  
- **Other Urgent Unknowns**: How do time-of-day, lighting, and crowd density interact with perceived safety? What self-protective routines emerge (if any)?

---

## 2. Experiment Type
- [x] Exploratory Experiment  
- [ ] Confirmatory Experiment  
- [ ] Technical Experiment

---

## 3. Modality and Fit
- **Modality Chosen**: Guided conversation using the Halo Alert Conversation Guide (story-first; emotional probes).  
- **Why it fits**: Captures lived experiences across commute segments (street → platform → train → egress) and surfaces emotional triggers (lighting, sparsity, proximity).

---

## 4. Design
- **Source of Evidence**: Professional women commuters near subway entrances/exits.  
- **Collection Mechanism**: Walk-up interview; recorded with consent using the Conversation Guide.  
- **Sampling Strategy**: Convenience sample at evening end-of-day; bias toward office workers leaving late.  
- **Sample Size Goal**: 2–5 initial interviews in this time window (Emily = evening/late case).

---

## 5. Execution Notes
- Approached outside a downtown Manhattan station as Emily left work later than usual.  
- Interview covered full journey home (downtown → Brooklyn) with emphasis on late hour and lighting conditions.  
- Duration: ~20 minutes; recorded with consent.  
- Deviations: Probed more on **route changes** and **lighting** after she mentioned a prior mugging incident nearby (not personally experienced).  
- Sampling bias: Skews toward late-evening commuter experience; not generalizable to daytime riders without additional interviews.

## 6. Results and Data Summary

**Representative Evidence (Excerpts):**
- *Late-night context & vigilance*:  
  “My commute home was much later than usual, around **9:30 PM**… fewer people, **dimmer street lights**… I kept my **headphones off** to be fully aware.”  

- *Train sparsity = eerie*:  
  “The subway car was **less crowded**… nice to have more space, but the **sparsity can feel eerie**. I kept my bag close and **avoided eye contact**.”  

- *Last-leg walk & micro-tactics*:  
  “The streets were almost empty… every sound seemed amplified… I walked **briskly**, **keys in my hand**, stayed in **well-lit areas**.”  

- *Underlying concerns vs. daytime*:  
  “I generally feel secure during regular hours… **after dark I’m more aware** of my surroundings and who’s around me.”  

- *Route change after incident nearby*:  
  “I stopped taking a shortcut through a **poorly lit alley** after hearing about a **mugging** there… Now I take a **longer, better-lit route** with more people.”  

- *Safety through connection*:  
  “I’ll **text my sister or a close friend**, share my **location** or check in… If they **don’t hear from me by a certain time**, they know to reach out.”

**Themes Identified:**
- **Lighting & Timing**: Darkness elevates vigilance; lighting quality is a major moderator of perceived safety.  
- **Density Curve**: Both **high density (crowded)** and **low density (sparse)** carry different discomforts; late-night **sparsity** triggers eeriness.  
- **Micro-Tactics for Control**: Keys in hand, headphones off, route selection to maximize light/visibility/foot traffic.  
- **Safety Through Connection**: Proactive messaging + ETA accountability with loved ones.  
- **Convenience vs. Safety Trade-off**: Willing to pay “time cost” (longer route) to reduce perceived risk.

## 7. Knowledge Updating
- **What do we now know?**  
  Late-evening conditions (low density + low light) shift commuters’ strategies toward **situational awareness** and **connection-based reassurance**. perceived safety is strongly tied to **environmental controllability** (light, sight lines, proximity of others).  
- **Confidence**: Moderate — converges with Sarah’s patterns (connection routines), but adds strong **lighting/timing** dimension; needs more off-peak interviews.  
- **Assumptions Updated/Abandoned**:  
  - Updated: “Physical risk” proxies (e.g., reported incidents) influence **route choice** even when not personally experienced.  
  - Abandoned: Assumption that crowding alone is the main driver; **sparsity** can be equally unsettling for different reasons.

## 8. Next Steps
- **Broaden sampling**: Add commuters on **bus**, **rideshare**, and **bike**; include **early-morning** riders and **weekend** late nights for contrast.  
- **Observation pairing**: Evening station/egress **observations** to validate lighting, foot traffic, and behavior cues.  
- **Hypothesis shaping**: Draft pain hypothesis around **“reassurance under low-control conditions”** (low light, low density, unfamiliar routes).  
- **Design signal tests**: Explore **low-friction check-in** mechanisms and **discreet triggers** that work with hands full or phone stowed.
