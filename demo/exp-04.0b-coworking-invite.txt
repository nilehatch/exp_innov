Subject: Looking for women commuters willing to share their stories  

Hi everyone,  
We’re a student team at [University/Program] working on a project about commuting experiences, especially for women who walk or take public transit as part of their daily routine.  

We’re not selling anything — just listening and learning. If you’d be willing to share a bit about your commute, please reply here or sign up for a short chat [insert scheduling link].  

We’ll keep everything anonymous, and your input will help us understand what really matters for people on the move.  

Thanks for considering,  
Halo Alert team
