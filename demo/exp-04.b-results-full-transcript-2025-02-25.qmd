# Opening & Rapport
**Interviewer:** Thank you for taking a moment to speak with me tonight. My name is Nile, and I’m learning from commuters about their everyday experiences. Could you please tell me your name?  

**Emily:** My name’s Emily Rivera.  

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Emily. I’d love to hear about your evening commute today, starting from when you left work.  

**Notes (context):**  
Emily works late some evenings and commutes home around 9:30 PM. Streets are quieter, lighting dimmer. She alters her routines for vigilance and reassurance.

# Story-First: “Tell me about your commute home today.” {#sec-emily-last-commute}
**Prompt:** *Tell me about your commute home this evening.*  

> **Emily (Transcript):**  
> “My commute home was much later than usual, around 9:30 PM. By then, the streets were quieter and the lighting was dimmer. Walking to the station, I felt a little uneasy—there weren’t as many people around. I kept my headphones off so I could be fully aware of my surroundings.”  

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Darkness + sparsity heighten unease; chooses sensory alertness (no headphones).

# Probe: “What was hardest about that experience?” {#sec-emily-hardest}
> **Emily (Transcript):**  
> “The hardest part is the lack of people. It’s nice not to be in a huge crowd, but when the streets or platforms are nearly empty, it makes you feel exposed. Every sound seems louder. I walked briskly, kept my bag close, and avoided eye contact with the few people I did pass.”  

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Trade-off between crowd comfort vs. exposure; somatic cues (sounds louder); protective tactics.  
:::

# Probe: “Why was that hard?” {#sec-emily-why-hard}
> **Emily (Transcript):**  
> “Because you start to wonder: *what if something happens?* There aren’t as many people around to notice or help. Even just waiting for the train, when only a couple of people are on the platform, I felt tense.”  

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Vulnerability rooted in lack of bystanders or witnesses; anticipatory fear.

# Probe: “How did you handle that situation?” {#sec-emily-handle}
> **Emily (Transcript):**  
> “I made small choices—stayed in well-lit areas, kept my keys in my hand, and walked faster than normal. On the train, I sat near the doors so I could get off quickly if needed.”  

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Behavioral adaptations: lighting preference, defensive posture, exit strategy.

# “Have you had another time you felt the same way?” (3-peat) {#sec-emily-repeat}
> **Emily (Transcript):**  
> “Yes, once I was walking home from the station and passed through a side street. It was dark and no one was around. I’d heard about a mugging in that area a few weeks before. I wasn’t harmed, but ever since then, I avoid that route and take a longer way home where there are more lights and people.”  

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Past incident nearby produces durable behavioral change; prioritizes reassurance over convenience.  
:::

---

# “Why did you change your route?” (5-whys) {#sec-emily-route}
> **Emily (Transcript):**  
> “Because I realized convenience wasn’t worth the risk. Even if nothing happens, the feeling of anxiety is enough. I’d rather walk an extra five minutes and feel safer.”  

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Value trade-off: time vs. psychological safety. Anxiety itself framed as cost.  
:::

---

# “What do you usually do to feel safer?” {#sec-emily-routines}
> **Emily (Transcript):**  
> “I often text my sister or a close friend when I leave work late. I’ll share my location or just say, ‘Heading home now, should be back by 10.’ If they don’t hear from me by then, they’ll check in. It’s reassuring to know someone’s paying attention.”  

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Connection ritual; accountability loop; shared location as safety proxy.

# Comparison: “How does this differ from commuting during the day?” {#sec-emily-day-vs-night}
> **Emily (Transcript):**  
> “During the day, I barely think about safety. There are so many people, the trains are crowded, and the streets are busy. But at night, even though there are fewer people, I feel like I have to be on high alert the entire time.”  

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Density flips valence: crowd = relief at night, crowd = nuisance by day.

# Referral {#sec-emily-referral}
**Interviewer:** Who else should we talk to?  

> **Emily (Transcript):**  
> “I think women who commute by bus might have a different perspective. The routes and waiting areas feel different at night compared to the subway.”

# Emerging Themes {#sec-emily-themes}
- **Lighting & Sparsity:** Darkness and emptiness amplify exposure and vigilance.  
- **Protective Tactics:** Adjusts behavior—keys in hand, quick pace, door proximity.  
- **Psychological Costs:** Anxiety itself drives avoidance and longer routes.  
- **Safety Through Connection:** Remote check-ins with family create reassurance.  
- **Day vs. Night Contrast:** Safety salience flips with crowd density and time.  

# Researcher Reflection {#sec-emily-reflection}
- **Surprises:** Anxiety framed not just as reaction but as cost in itself.  
- **Assumptions Updated:** Crowds are not universally stressful; in some contexts they are protective.  
- **Next Steps:** Compare day/night commuter coping strategies; explore digital check-in practices as implicit “safety tech.”
