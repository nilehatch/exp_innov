# Sample Intercept Screener {.unnumbered}

This screener is designed for **short, in-the-moment checks** (e.g., on the street, outside a subway, in a café). It helps you quickly identify whether someone fits your target profile and is willing to participate in a short interview or observation.

## Introduction (Script)

Hello, my name is [your name]. I’m a student working on a project about [general problem space].

Can I ask you a few quick questions? It’ll only take a minute.

## Notes for Field Teams

- If someone hesitates, reassure them: *“We’re just students, not a company. We’re trying to learn.”*  
- Respect refusals immediately — thank them for their time.
