## Context {.unnumbered}

This document demonstrates how the Halo Alert team moved from *divergent exploration* of possible communities to a *converged choice* of focus. It follows the **Convergence Guide** and illustrates each step with real decisions, reflections, and evidence from the team’s early work.


## 1. Compare: Spot Patterns and Weigh Possibilities {#sec-ha-people-converge-compare}

**Candidate groups under review (from Diverge stage):**

- College women walking home at night  
- Professional women commuting on foot in mid-sized cities  
- Female university students crossing campus after dark  
- Shift workers returning home before sunrise  
- Immigrant women using late-night buses  
- Elderly women commuting by public transit  
- Women in rural areas walking to jobs without cars  

**Patterns noticed:**

- **Recurring theme of vigilance**: across nearly all groups, women adapted routines for safety (texting friends, carrying keys, rerouting).  
- **Time-of-day effect**: concerns intensified at night or in dark/isolated areas.  
- **Transit + walking overlap**: many groups blended public transit with walking — friction arose especially in “last mile” segments.  
- **Uneven visibility in mainstream solutions**: tech apps and products largely targeted “generic commuters” or “college safety,” not nuanced subgroups.  

::: callout-tip
**Team reflection:** Professional women commuters and female students showed *layered patterns*: safety behaviors woven into daily life, often invisible to outsiders. These weren’t dramatic events, but steady frictions.

## 2. Empathize: Notice the Emotional Pull {#sec-ha-people-converge-empathize}

Groups that lingered after work sessions:  
- **Professional women commuters** — stories of texting roommates, rerouting streets, balancing career pressure with constant background vigilance.  
- **College students** — raw vulnerability late at night, but often constrained by campus access rules (harder to study without IRB).  

**What stuck emotionally:**  
The team couldn’t shake the quiet burden of professional women who “looked fine” yet carried routines of self-protection every day. Unlike campus students, these women rarely voiced complaints — they had normalized fear.  

::: callout-note
**Signal of empathy:** Team members reported “feeling protective” and a sense of injustice — *why should these capable professionals still have to carry keys between their fingers?*

## 3. Assess Access: Can You Actually Reach Them? {#sec-ha-people-converge-access}

**Quick tests conducted:**  
- Draft LinkedIn messages to small networks of women in New York and Boston.  
- Pilot outreach in coworking Slack group: short invite for 15–20 min conversations.  
- Intercept attempts outside subway exits near campus.  

**Results:**  
- LinkedIn: 3 out of 5 messages received thoughtful replies within 48 hours.  
- Slack group: 8 women volunteered stories or referrals.  
- Subway intercept: 2 agreed to short chats, though one declined recording.  

**Assessment:**

- [x] Observable in public settings.  
- [x] Reachable through professional and digital networks.  
- [x] Willing to engage, offering thoughtful accounts.  


## 4. Select Your People {#sec-ha-people-converge-select}

**Decision:**  
Halo Alert chose to focus on **professional women commuting on foot in mid-sized cities**.  

**Rationale:**  
- Clear patterns of persistent, subtle safety burdens.  
- Emotional resonance: the team felt drawn to their lived experience.  
- Proven access: multiple channels worked quickly and respectfully.  

**Note:** This was treated as a *working commitment*, not a final lock-in. The team acknowledged definitions would evolve as pain points clarified.

## Attachments (Data Room Pointers)

- **Comparison board (Miro capture)** — clusters of candidate groups & overlap patterns.  
- **Empathy notes** — debrief docs where team recorded “lingering voices.”  
- **Access tracker sheet** — outreach attempts, response rates, notes on tone of replies.  
- **Draft outreach messages** — short LinkedIn / Slack scripts.  

---

## Researcher Reflection

- **Surprises:** Volume and thoughtfulness of replies from professional women via Slack — faster and deeper than expected.  
- **Updated assumptions:** Safety concerns aren’t always voiced; they’re embedded in daily rituals.  
- **Next step:** Launch ethnographic exploration (conversations, observations) with this group to surface unmet needs.
