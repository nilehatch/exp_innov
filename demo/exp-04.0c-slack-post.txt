👋 Hey folks — we’re doing a student project on commuting experiences for women who walk or take public transit.  

Q: What’s the hardest or most stressful part of your commute?  
Q: What helps you feel safer or more comfortable along the way?  

Would love to hear your stories or quick thoughts. Totally anonymous outside this group.  
Thanks in advance 🙏
