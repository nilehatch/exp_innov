- **Date**: [24 February 2024]  
- **Location / Setting**: Outside Queens–Midtown subway route, New York  
- **Team Member(s)**: Nile  
- **Modality**: Interview (exploratory)  
- **Linked Primary Experiment**: Diamond 2 — Find and Validate Pain for Professional Women Commuters  

---

## 1. Clarify the Unknown 
- **Most Urgent Unknown**: What pains or unmet needs do professional women face during their daily commute?  
- **Other Urgent Unknowns**: 

    1. Are these pains related more to predictability, safety, or control?  
    2. What is the most salient stage of the commute?
    3. Are the pains different for professional women and college students?

## 2. Experiment Type
- [x] Exploratory Experiment  
- [ ] Confirmatory Experiment  
- [ ] Technical Experiment  

---

## 3. Modality and Fit
- **Modality Chosen**: Guided conversation interview using the Conversation Guide  
- **Why it fits**: Allows uncovering of personal stories and emotional triggers around commuting, rather than surface-level or hypothetical responses.  

---

## 4. Design
- **Source of Evidence**: Professional women exiting/entering subway stations  
- **Collection Mechanism**: Halo Alert Conversation Guide (story-first + emotional probes)  
- **Sampling Strategy**: Walk-up interviews of commuters during morning/evening transitions  
- **Sample Size Goal**: 2–5 interviews (Sarah = first participant)  

---

## 5. Execution Notes
- Approached Sarah leaving Astoria station during morning commute.  
- Rapport established; she described a full door-to-door journey.  
- Interview lasted ~20 minutes, recorded with consent.  
- No major deviations, though follow-up questions leaned heavily into emotional triggers (e.g., frustration during reroutes).  
- Sample bias: early-morning commuter, professional context, not representative of all demographics.

## 6. Results and Data Summary

**Representative Evidence (Excerpts):**

- *On rerouting*:  
  “You develop this sort of rhythm in your daily routine, and unexpected changes, even small ones, can throw you off… I wasn’t familiar with the detour route, which made me slightly anxious.”  

- *On crowded trains*:  
  “I do find myself becoming more vigilant… It’s not outright fear, but there’s definitely a sense of wariness… My pulse quickens if someone brushes against me.”  

- *On personal discomfort*:  
  “The most uncomfortable part is overcrowded trains — personal space disappears, and getting off at my stop becomes nerve-wracking.”  

- *On safety routines*:  
  “Whenever I’m commuting late, I send a quick text to my roommate or close friend. We even set up a system — if I don’t check in by a certain time, she knows to reach out.”  

**Themes Identified (from notes):**  
- Predictability matters (disruption = frustration + anxiety).  
- Vigilance over belongings in crowds (heightened alertness, not fear).  
- Discomfort tied to *situations* (overcrowding, darkness) rather than locations.  
- Coping routines create a sense of *control and connection*.

## 7. Knowledge Updating
- **What do you now know?** Commuters balance efficiency and safety, but psychological security (control, predictability, connection) is as important as physical safety.  
- **Confidence level**: Moderate — consistent with expectations but revealed richer emotional nuance than hypothesized.  
- **Assumptions updated**: Originally assumed “safety risk” was primarily physical (theft, assault). In reality, *feeling safe* often comes from **control routines** (e.g., texts, route choice).  

---

## 8. Next Steps
- Interview additional women at different times (late evening, early morning, non-rush hour).  
- Cross-validate with observational notes at stations.  
- Cluster across multiple transcripts to draft a **pain hypothesis** around *predictability + reassurance*.
