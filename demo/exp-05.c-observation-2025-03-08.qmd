  - Navigational uncertainty (maps, routes).  
  - Managing mobility while carrying heavy loads (books, bags).  

- **Workarounds**:  
  - Sticking to lit paths, hoodies up, brisk walking.  
  - Walking in pairs/groups for safety.  
  - Using pets, music, or phones as comfort/distraction.  

- **Social dynamics**:  
  - Groups feel relaxed and expressive.  
  - Solo travelers visibly tense, often scanning surroundings.  
  - Small rituals of reassurance (friends calming each other, nods to joggers).  

## 4. Next Steps
- Explore how late-night students perceive campus safety and what tools they use to cope.  
- Test whether group-walking apps, buddy systems, or lighting interventions reduce anxiety.  
- Interview students about trade-offs between independence, convenience, and safety measures.
