# Opening & Rapport
**Interviewer:** Good morning, thank you so much for agreeing to speak with me today. My name is Nile, and I'm exploring the experiences of commuters in urban settings. May I have your name, please?

**Sarah:** Good morning, Nile. I'm Sarah Thompson.

**Interviewer:** Nice to meet you, Sarah. Before we dive into the specifics of your commute, could you share a bit about yourself — perhaps your age, the area you're living in, and where you commute to for work?

**Notes (context):**  
Sarah begins her commute by walking ~15 minutes to the nearest subway, rides ~20 minutes, then walks ~10 minutes to her office in Midtown. She enjoys the rhythm of the city but stays alert during early mornings and late evenings.

# Story-First: “Tell me about your last commute.” {#sec-last-commute}
**Prompt:** *Tell me about the last time you commuted from Astoria to Midtown.*

> **Sarah (Transcript):**  
> “Last Friday, I left my apartment in Astoria a bit later than usual, around 8:30 AM. The sun was already high, casting a warm, golden hue over the streets. I enjoy these morning walks; they're my little moments of peace before the day gets hectic. The neighborhood was lively, with local cafes brewing fresh coffee and fellow commuters hurrying along the sidewalks.  
>  
> As I walked towards the subway station, I noticed more street artists than usual, their music adding a unique soundtrack to my commute. I always keep my headphones in, though – a personal bubble of my favorite podcast, it makes the walk feel shorter.  
>  
> The subway was crowded, as expected during rush hours. I managed to find a spot to stand and held onto a pole, keeping my balance as the train swayed through the tunnels. After about twenty minutes, I arrived in Midtown and emerged into the bustling streets. The last leg of my commute is a ten-minute walk to the office. I particularly enjoy this part; the energy of Midtown is invigorating, with people of all walks of life crossing paths.  
>  
> However, the streets were a bit more chaotic than usual. A sudden roadblock rerouted pedestrian traffic, adding a couple of extra minutes to my walk. But it was fine, I made it to the office just in time for my first meeting.”

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Left later (8:30 AM); sunny, lively streets; uses podcasts to create personal space; typical rush-hour crowds; slight delay due to roadblock; overall positive mood despite minor disruption.

# Probe: “Tell me more about being rerouted.” {#sec-reroute}
**Prompt:** *Even though it turned out fine, you seemed frustrated (observed). What made it unsettling?*

> **Sarah (Transcript):**  
> “Well, yes, you're right. I was a bit frustrated at that moment. It's just that you develop this sort of rhythm in your daily routine, and unexpected changes, even small ones, can throw you off a bit. When I saw the roadblock and the crowd being diverted, my first thought was about the extra time it would add to my commute, and I worried about being late for my meeting.  
>  
> I also wasn't familiar with the detour route, which made me slightly anxious. I prefer knowing exactly where I'm going, especially during rush hours when every minute counts. And in those moments, the streets feel more chaotic, everyone's in a rush, and it's not just about the physical rerouting but also mentally recalibrating your route and time.  
>  
> Thankfully, it wasn't a significant detour, and I managed to navigate through it quickly. But yes, at that moment, it was a bit unsettling, not knowing how much of a delay it would cause or if I'd encounter any other unexpected issues along the new path.”

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Routine disruption → frustration; uncertainty about detour → anxiety; prefers known routes; mental load of “recalibration” under time pressure; detour minor but psychologically salient.

# “What is the most hectic part of your commute?” {#sec-hectic}
> **Sarah (Transcript):**  
> “The busiest part of my commute is definitely the segment when I enter the subway station and during the train ride itself. Especially during rush hours, the station is packed…  
>  
> Once I'm on the train, the hectic feeling continues, though it's more confined. The train is usually crowded, and finding a spot where I don't feel squished can sometimes be a challenge… I try to stay aware of my surroundings, keeping my belongings close and making sure I'm ready to navigate through the crowd when it's time to get off.  
>  
> …It's hectic, for sure, but also a fascinating part of city life.”

::: callout-note
**Notes:** High-density crowds; vigilance over space and belongings; “individual isolation” amid proximity; practiced readiness to board/alight.

# “Tell me more about worrying over belongings.” {#sec-belongings}
> **Sarah (Transcript):**  
> “Yes, during those crowded train rides, I do find myself becoming more vigilant… It's not outright fear, but there's definitely a sense of wariness… I'm usually holding my bag very close to me… ensuring it’s in my sight at all times.  
>  
> …If someone brushes against me or if there's a sudden stop and people shuffle, my pulse quickens a bit, and I'm immediately checking my belongings.”

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Heightened alertness (somatic cues like quickened pulse); proactive bag control; constant monitoring; tension peaks with jostling or surprises.
:::

---

# “What part makes you feel most uncomfortable?” {#sec-uncomfortable}
> **Sarah (Transcript):**  
> “I think the part that makes me the most uncomfortable isn't a specific location or time but certain **situations**, particularly when the train is **overcrowded**… personal space becomes virtually non-existent…  
>  
> There's also the aspect of getting off at my stop when the train is that packed… a bit nerve-wracking…  
>  
> …the vigilance about my personal safety and belongings… intensifies in those really cramped spaces.”

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Discomfort is situational (overcrowding), not geographic; exit anxiety; vigilance spikes with density.
:::

---

# “How has your commute changed over time?” {#sec-changes}
> **Sarah (Transcript):**  
> “When I first started… everything was new and required a lot of attention… anxiety dropped as I became familiar with the route…  
>  
> …schedule and route changes… shifts in crowd patterns…  
>  
> I’ve made adjustments: choosing less crowded cars, platform position, and timing to avoid peak hours.”

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Adaptation and optimization; familiarity lowers baseline anxiety; micro-strategies to manage density.
:::

# “Moments when you felt less secure?” {#sec-less-secure}
> **Sarah (Transcript):**  
> “One evening… subway was less crowded… someone behaving erratically… made me feel uneasy… I wished I wasn’t alone in the car… felt trapped until the next station.  
>  
> Another time… winter, dark early… poorly lit areas made the walk feel more daunting… constant looking over my shoulder… relief in well-lit, crowded spots.”

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Off-peak sparsity → eeriness and entrapment feeling; lighting is a strong moderator of perceived safety; seeks visibility and crowds for reassurance.
:::

---

# “Do you have safety habits or routines?” {#sec-routines}
> **Sarah (Transcript):**  
> “Yes… especially after those unsettling experiences. Whenever I'm commuting late or in a less crowded car, I send a quick text to my roommate or a close friend… share my location and ETA…  
>  
> We have a system — if I don't message again by a certain time or don't come home as expected, my friend knows to reach out… These small actions give me a sense of control and reassurance.”

::: callout-note
**Notes:** “Safety through connection” routine; lightweight protocol with accountability; boosts perceived control.
:::

---

# “Are the messages about safety or catching up?” {#sec-motive}
> **Sarah (Transcript):**  
> “Primarily about **safety**. It makes me feel like I'm not alone in those vulnerable moments… The primary intent is ensuring my safety and maintaining a sense of connection with someone who knows where I am.”

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Intent is safety-first; companionship effect reduces vulnerability.
:::

---

# “How much of your walking time is spent thinking about safety?” {#sec-safety-time}
> **Sarah (Transcript):**  
> “Safety is a subtle but constant thread… more **active** during certain parts. Morning walk feels relatively safe; just casual awareness.  
>  
> Evening/darker segments → **heightened vigilance**; a good portion of mental energy devoted to surroundings.  
>  
> Out of ~25 minutes of walking, actively thinking about safety for ~**10–15 minutes**, mainly evenings or less busy areas. On the train, safety thoughts linger in the background, especially when crowded.”

::: callout-note
**Notes:** Time-of-day and density are key moderators; meaningful “cognitive tax” of vigilance (10–15 min/25).

# Referral {#sec-referral}
**Interviewer:** Who else should we talk to?

> **Sarah (Transcript):**  
> “My friend Alex takes the same subway route but has a slightly different perspective… She’s used public transportation for years and has interesting stories about ups and downs.”

# Emerging Themes {#sec-themes}
- **Predictability & Control:** Routine disruptions (reroutes) create outsized stress under time constraints.  
- **Density & Proximity:** Overcrowding drives vigilance and discomfort; exit anxiety at packed stops.  
- **Lighting & Timing:** Darkness and off-peak sparsity amplify perceived vulnerability.  
- **Safety Through Connection:** Lightweight check-in protocols (texts, location sharing) deliver reassurance.  
- **Cognitive Load:** Safety vigilance imposes a recurring mental tax during specific commute segments.

# Researcher Reflection {#sec-reflection}
- **Surprises:** Emotional salience of *minor* reroutes; the specificity of exit anxiety.  
- **Assumptions Updated:** “Safety” is as much psychological (control, reassurance) as physical risk.  
- **Next Steps:** Expand interviews to late-night riders, different lines; pair with **observations** at entrances/exits; compare with different commuting modes (bus, rideshare, biking).
