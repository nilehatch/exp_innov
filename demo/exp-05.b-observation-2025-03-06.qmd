## 1. Clarify the Unknown
- **Most Urgent Unknown**: How do commuters balance safety, fatigue, and social interaction in evening transit routines?  
- **Context**: Post-workday, evening crowd, mix of commuters and locals.  

## 2. Raw Observation Notes
- Business formal woman with laptop bag, walking briskly, repeatedly checking phone, quickens pace after seeing time. Also scans surroundings and sticks to streetlights.  
- Couple on bench sharing takeout, unwinding after day. Not co-workers, more personal connection.  
- Musician playing near entrance, soft guitar music.  
- Group around food cart, laughing, snacking, socializing.  
- Woman in business attire sitting on bench, checking phone, visibly tired, clutching bag.  
- Group of young professionals, casually dressed with work bags, animated discussion.  
- Solo traveler (young woman with backpack), anxious, checking map, boards, phone, surroundings repeatedly.  
- Worker in uniform carrying cleaning supplies, fatigued.  
- Woman in red coat rushes out of subway, checks watch, accelerates.  
- Lady with tote bag fumbles with earphones, drops one, multitasking.  
- Young woman in business suit on phone, brisk pace.  
- Person juggling multiple bags and coffee, stops to rearrange before continuing.  

## 3. Emerging Patterns & Surprises
- **Visible frictions**:  
  - Safety concerns (choosing lit paths, scanning surroundings).  
  - Fatigue and stress after workday.  
  - Burden of multitasking (bags, food, coffee, tech).  

- **Workarounds**:  
  - Sticking to streetlights to avoid risk.  
  - Rearranging bags mid-commute.  
  - Taking rest breaks (sitting, eating, chatting).  

- **Social dynamics**:  
  - Shared food/social rituals as decompression.  
  - Music as soft community anchor.  
  - Solo travelers visibly more anxious, vulnerable.  

## 4. Next Steps
- Investigate how evening commuters perceive personal safety and what strategies they rely on.  
- Explore whether food, music, or shared pauses meaningfully reduce commuter stress.  
- Test whether fatigue and multitasking open opportunities for commuter support services (carry aids, mobile tools, safety apps).
