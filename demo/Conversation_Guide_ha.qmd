#### Halo Alert Commuter Interviews {.subtitle} 

**Context:** These interviews were part of the *Halo Alert* team’s early exploratory experiments during **Diamond 2: Understand an Unmet Need**. The team focused on professional women and female university students who commute via walking and public transit.

## Before the Conversation  
- **Protocol:** Engage women commuters outside urban/suburban metro stations. Aim for natural, conversational tone rather than a rigid questionnaire.  
- **Resources:** Notebook + recorder (with consent).  
- **Introduction:**  
  “Hi, my name is Nile. I’m working on a student project to better understand people’s commuting experiences. I’m not selling anything — I’d just love to hear your perspective. The conversation will take 15–20 minutes. Is it okay if I ask a few questions, and possibly record for accuracy?”  

---

## Opening and Rapport  
- Exchange names, age (optional), and commuting origin/destination.  
- Ask about the *shape of their commute* (walking, subway, bus, etc.).

## Story-First Questions  
(Anchor to *specific past commutes*.)  

1. “Tell me about your last commute.”  
   - Probe: “What stood out about that day?”  
   - Probe: “What was different from your usual?”  

2. “What’s the most hectic part of your commute?”  
   - Probe: “How do you feel in those moments?”  
   - Probe: “What do you do to manage the chaos?”  

3. “When do you feel uncomfortable during your commute?”  
   - Probe: “Can you tell me about a time when that happened?”  
   - Probe: “What did you do to handle it?”  

4. “Are you ever concerned about your belongings?”  
   - Probe: “What goes through your mind in crowded spaces?”  

5. “How safe do you feel, personally, during your commute?”  
   - Probe: “Can you describe a time when you felt unsafe?”  
   - Probe: “How did you respond in that moment?”

## Emotional Triggers  
(Probe when you notice body language or emotion.)

- “I noticed you paused there — can you tell me more?”  
- “Why was that stressful for you?”  
- “What would I not expect about that experience?”  
- Use **5 Whys** to dig into root causes: “Why was that important to you?”  

*Example tied to Sarah:* “It seems like you were frustrated by the detour, even though you arrived fine. Why did that throw you off?”  

*Example tied to Emily:* “You mentioned feeling tense walking home at night. Why does the lighting or quietness affect you so strongly?”  

---

## Closing  
- “Has your commute changed over time? How?”  
- “What routines or habits help you feel safer?”  
- “Who else should we talk to who might have different commuting experiences?”  
- Thank them sincerely and explain: “Your experiences will help us better understand commuting challenges. We’ll never use your name, but your story helps us see patterns.”

## After the Conversation  
- **Debrief immediately:** What surprised us? What patterns did we hear?  
- **Document:** Store transcript + notes in the Supporting Experiment template.  
- **Feed into analysis:** Later cluster insights into themes (predictability, vigilance, connection).
