## Bias Check Additions

To counteract convenience bias (only focusing on obvious commuting women in NYC), we deliberately added three non-obvious groups:

1. **International students on urban campuses**  
   - Quick Profile: Often commute on foot late at night after study groups; culturally less likely to report safety fears.  
   - Why Added: Visibility is lower; needs may differ due to cultural norms.  
   - Access: Campus cultural clubs, international student office.  

2. **Elderly women commuting to part-time jobs**  
   - Quick Profile: Commute early/late on limited incomes; may use bus or subway.  
   - Why Added: Overlooked due to age; different safety perceptions and physical vulnerabilities.  
   - Access: Senior centers, church groups, job placement programs.  

3. **Immigrant women working late service shifts**
    - **Quick Profile**: Women employed in restaurants, cleaning, or retail who often walk or use transit home after midnight. Language barriers and documentation status can compound vulnerability.
    - **Why Added**: Frequently invisible to mainstream “professional women” framing; experience late-night exposure and systemic neglect.
    - **Access**: Worker advocacy orgs, ESL classes, churches, and immigrant community associations.

**Reflection:**  
These adds diversify our exploration, forcing us to see beyond the default category of “professional young women.” They highlight cultural, generational, and identity-driven differences that mainstream safety products rarely account for.
