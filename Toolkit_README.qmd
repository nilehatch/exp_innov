# Toolkit Overview

This toolkit equips you to document your experiments like a practicing scientist. You will use these tools to:

- Reduce uncertainty
- Record your evidence and reasoning
- Build cumulative knowledge
- Guide next steps in your venture

## Toolkit Structure

It includes:

- **Manifesto and Guide**: Philosophy of documentation
- **Primary Experiment Template**: Use this for major expeditionary innovation experiments (people access, pain, solution)
- **Supporting Experiment Template**: Use this for exploratory and supporting (intermediate) experiments (exploratory, confirmatory, and technical experiments)
- **Experiment Log Tracker**: Use this to index and track all experiments
- **Toolkit README**:  This document


## Usage Instructions

1. Copy the appropriate template for each experiment or field note.
2. Keep all docs in your project or team folder.
3. For each experiment or field observation:

    - Go to the relevant template (primary or supporting)
    - File → Make a copy
    - Rename it clearly 
        
            Recommended File Naming Convention
            - Exp [##] – [Short Title] – [Date]
            - Sup – [Date] – [Group or Activity]
            - (e.g., Exp 03 – Cafeteria Observations – 2025-09-12)
        
    - Place your copy in your team's working folder

4. Update your Experiment Log Tracker with each new entry


## Best Practices

- Document immediately after you gather data
- Be honest about surprises, gaps, and mistakes
- Write to your *future self* and your teammates
- Link any external data, recordings, or images in your documents

## What You’re Building

By the end of your expedition, you will have a **recorded trail of discovery**, a logic of decisions, and an epistemic foundation for whatever you choose to launch.

This is not busywork. This is the work.
